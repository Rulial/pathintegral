Recently, in the FAQ I mentioned about running a crowd funding campaign for a short film titled "You are a MingXing"—> "You are a Star" translated from Chinese. There's an interesting little story I would love to share about its not making and can be classified as “how not to start up” 😭😁

I wrote this script back in 2011 while the social media craze was still catching up as almost the whole world was onboarding though not sure what to make of it—> a satire about the celebrity status bestowed upon everyone. Tried to make it a few times in London on shoe string budgets but did not pan out.

2013, I had just been sent packing back to India from London, not sure where to land. Had made another live action short film 'Phil was There’ a few months back that was being sent to some festivals based on the availability of funds.

Crowd funding was the current thing back then but I had no "social equity" or capital and it was not difficult to ascertain that no one was going to give me any money if I ran a crowd funding campaign, maybe some would but that won't be enough.

I was analyzing the whole game, closely watching everything being put on Kickstarter and Indigo—> two major crowd funding platforms at that time. Was even trying to significantly up my social media presence with this in mind though traction was hard to find, not being part of any 😘Gang back then.

I spotted a friend of an acquaintance promoting his own Crowd Funding Platform—> lets call it "Fair Street" for the purpose of this tell tale as I have not asked their permission to write this and one just doesn't know what might offend people these days 🤷‍♂️

'Fair Street' had about two projects listed and you could tell they were personal connections of the founders which is fine, that's how things get built up in the early days of any venture. I approached one of the founders as previously had an interaction with him through acquaintance and he was interested in putting the project out there. Though, I had an inkling he was slightly over estimating the combined social capital and interest of everyone involved in the project.

Here's the thing—> the whole reason I even approached this platform over Kickstarter and Indigo was because I thought they were merely starting, wanted to compete with the big boys and girls of crowd funding otherwise what's even the point of building this? They were three people who seemed to be doing well financially.

Therefore, why would they let an organically sourced, only third project listed on their platform sink? It made no sense at all. What would had made sense is if they either fund part of the project or whole of it from their pocket or at least talk to negotiate some deal where they put in half and somehow I convince someone to put in the other half or just make the short film with only their half.

That would have worked out in everyone's favour with us making the movie and them getting amazing positive PR for their platform being able to find funding for a down to torn struggling film makers. Something to show for it as well! Because even though I don't like to praise my own work but the script was just amazing with among other things interest from a doofus producer in the States wanting to make it without me directing 🤣

I even tried to subtly bring this point to the founders of 'Fair Street' but they would just not take the hints and were more interested in spying on which photographs i was clicking on Instagram/ Facebook or suggesting ways I could spread the word not realising I had already thought of all the possible ways and none of it had any chance of working.

Any formal strategies might have worked on Kickstarter or Indigo coming with trust to the users being established platforms though no one had heard about 'Fair Street', add my lack of credibility along with lack of interest from rest of team in properly promoting the project—> probably everyone thought I am trying to run away with the money once raised for some reason, maybe, passion comes with seeds of doubt 🤦‍♂️. I kept working on that short film script for years, generating interest from a lot of people who wanted to ruin it with their pity egoistic thinking and later turned it into a long form series though still did not get made.

To their credit, 'Fair Street' founders did try to promote the project with their own funds on a few known independent film news websites and I could not tell to their faces that they were not being smart. Even had one of their own contacts put some show money in the campaign and were afraid i would try to claim it, thinking its an actual backer 🤦‍♂️—> of course I knew and no did not claim anything. Crowd Funding platforms are not technical marvels that can just find people who are ready to give money away especially in the early stages. There is no one to target with the algorithms! It's a game of promoted traction till you build an interested + dedicated community that can spread the word for you. Otherwise, why wouldn't I just put up a web page myself with a couple of PayPal links?!

I would have gone into this type of Venture with the capacity to fund at least 10 projects on my own, making sure they deliver because that would put the word out there. But they would send me message about "not getting depressed and offers for therapeutic conversations"—> only depressing thing was their lack of business acumen. 🫣 Had figured no one would give the money, though was a little disappointed that absolutely no one gave even a penny but depressed i was not because it was a highly probable and known possibility.

The lead actress in New York was pregnant during this time so I couldn't have bothered her much even though initially she did try to promote it—> her children have grown up wonderfully well. So, it’s a blessing that something great came of out loosely related to this 🤣 sorry, awkward joke. The rest of them were only in it half heartedly, knew deep down they hated my guts and it was apparent when later on they would promote their own crowd funding projects with much enthusiasm.

I find it all quite funny to be honest, my suspicion that no one liked me were proven by practical measures 🤣 and was quite liberating ❤️

Maybe next time, I will tell you all a story from 2010 about pitching Science Fiction Bullock Carts racing in Futuristic Rural Olympics as Star Warisque magnum opus to Rupert Murdoch of India 🇮🇳
