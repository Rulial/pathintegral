    I am aligned with humanity and everything non fiction is written from that perspective by default. Then, it's mentioned when other layers are added on top.
    
    Nothing in this document is written for any specific individual or organization/ institution or government, therefore, no one should take unnecessary offence.
    
    If I wanted to address anything specific than specific examples would have been given alongside with evidence to make a proper point with responsibility.
    
    This has nothing to do with any Geo Political Issues whatsoever.

*Recently, I listened to an episode of Andrew Huberman podcast with Marc Andereessen which inspired me to write this think piece. Here’s a link to the podcast for those who would want to have a listen before or after—>*

The subjects that really stood out from this podcast episode were Risk taking, the hypocrisy of social engineering + bullshit mechanics of Cancel Culture and various topics related to AI.

As I wrote in a previous essay "[HOW DO YOU TECHNOLOGY—> Think Piece](HOW%20DO%20YOU%20TECHNOLOGY%20%E2%80%94%20Think%20Piece%202d0312eac7124e198505abefcaeb20b4.md)" progress never failed us, greed did and still does. Taking risks is part of making progress and it's not a question about if but when you will fail because everything fails after it has run its course and we get to build a better version—> Facebook after MySpace? Instagram and X along with 10 other AI platforms and products now. Let's keep that in the back of our minds because subconsciously we will keep circling back to this thought.

Andrew and Marc talked about disagreeability being an important trait of innovators which sounds correct though would like to add that disagreeability could also mean lack of understanding due to unwillingness to properly communicate. This does not only mean person to person dialogue but have both parties applied multiple perspectives to ascertain the proposed action or non action by another?

Is the disagreement about the approach or the outcome? Both are different mindsets because anyone focused on a singular outcome will not understand the optimal process which does not mean tried, tested or guaranteed but the way of least damage in terms of time and money while having maximum options for adjustment to keep reaching incremental goals.

I love this quote from Mad Men "What is happiness? It's a moment before you need more happiness." Don Draper. This applies to everything we do—> whether you have achieved a goal or not, time does not stop, sun will set and rise as any failure you are concerned with or achievement you are proud of will fade. It's a fallacy of short sightedness to perform for outcomes rather than the joy of performance itself.

The only risks is not taking one or not letting others take it for whatever irrelevant concerns.

This leads us right into the hypocrisy of social engineering and cancel culture—>

If we go back a few years, for most of civilized history our primary way to regulate community groups situated anywhere on earth was the spoken word without any way to record real time communication for playback and reference. Books are great for those who take the pain of reading and understanding them but sadly the percentage of people with those skills or interested in building those skills is quite low.

But spoken word from one person to another could rapidly change meaning, therefore, anything said by anyone was/is always up for debate, intent and purpose based on whom you asked, their motivation or persuasion by any third party. This is why conformity within a group was achieved through strict daily patterns made of gestures or symbols—> heavily subject to manipulation of misinterpretation based on the power structures of these groups.

Then came the ability to record the spoken word—> audio. You could listen to what is said again and again based on access to the recordings to ascertain its meaning. What changed from delivering a real time spoken word lost to memory but now realising your speech is being recorded and can be reproduced?

Then came the ability to record video as an ultimate treat. From having complete dependence on our own cognitive tools for interpretation many of us outsourced our sensibilities to audio and video recordings. The access was still quite limited though, it could reach more people but not based on their own choice. Still the speaker has this responsibility to make sure they are making sense otherwise bad word of mouth could mean bad things.

If we consider leaders as primary representatives of the gap between our aspirations and the various rule books of life then who are the people interpreting the leaders for a general audience?—> these are different levels of non linear communication.

Surely, everything is a feature + a privilege but what are the side effects? Not only for the speaker but also for the listeners, i would ask primarily for the listeners? Is it possible that rather than using their own minds in real time there is an over reliance on following the recorded audio or video which on its own has limited relevance in this current moment and should only be used as reference to strict filters? It's difficult to say because much of the substance is in the details of the audience.

Is this a city audience? Is this a village audience? What percentage of people are educated in these groups? The kind and level of education? But it is really difficult to find how many different levels of educated or uneducated people actually have any common sense? How much of that common sense is based on spoken or written language? Are they free from group thinking? Or subject to manipulation? It's not only difficult to ascertain numerous factors but even today you can not find this type of acute relevancy in data even with a super computer—> a brain reading computer without understanding of the mind would surely be a disaster.

There was no direct or easy way to track individuals back in the olden times—> always a layer of interpretation in between no matter the training or guidelines in place. Therefore, analysis by local representation took precedent. Mostly all calculations were based upon interpretation of a self anointed leader or a powerful person appointed by his/her subordinates which if you think is a pretty shoddy way of doing things. But at least it worked in the short term rather than being in stasis due to the lack of any actual options. As a result pretty quickly these structures also became sources of privilege and power—> not specifically talking about geo politics only but general local group structures in any domain, around the world.

The representatives not only wanted to hold onto the power and privilege for as long as possible but also by any means necessary which is directly contradictory to their job of providing fair analysis leading to conflict of interest with local, surrounding and groups higher up in the chain—> a mess. Again, important to emphasize this is not only about politics but also other organisational aspects of society.

In most cases, there's a rule book to regulate these group structures agreed by individual members or the sub groups. Even if the rule book is great, it's extremely impractical to expect seamless implementation of words in real world settings over a sustained period of time from inside chaotic structures. Therefore, the human system has to perform within these evolving conditions while adapting the only long term practical solution—> transparent and corruption free democratic values working as self balancing struggle between the theorists, the interpreters and the experimentalists. It's extremely difficult to find + keep this balance at all times and that is why we face periods of stagnation or polarization.

There's no exact point of separation between the three categories of theorist, interpreters and experimentalists. We all have these attributes but in different capacities which is also based on environment, function and character development at different stages of life.

Coming back to the point of written word not available for real time citing but only via the memory at different stages which is advantageous to any power wielding personality if they want to have their way at least in the short term till their maneuvering hits a wall. This shortcoming has been widely used as a tool by dictators throughout history and almost always ends in fighting useless wars. If anyone finds this relatable, introspection is more valuable than taking unnecessary offense as the earlier can lead to conflict resolution—> to whom it may concern. Facts are not criticism but direction.

As a result, we have courts and what not to fix all these problems arising out of misinterpretations, to say there are gaps + outside factors in all communication which takes much time to fix after the fact or more simply put—> people losing their mind is an ever present issue. Psychological problems arising out of insecurities and a lack of proper support for a child to explore and find their own inner balance between theory, interpretation and experimentation are major contributors to misinterpretations of values as adults.

Another category of misinterpretation which has nothing to do with the actual crime or even anticipation of it but blatant confirmation bias and out of context insecurities significant enough for some lazy people falling to the black arts of social engineering, prosecution by pre-motion, to fix things before they happen, based on interpretations of gestures and symbols rather than by the rules in the book or anything actually happening in reality.

Andrew and Marc in their conversations mentioned such entities believing in their purpose and that might well be the case. Though, most such entities also believe in money and control—> zero sum games. The people taking on these roles as "saviours" know they are not well equipped to actually solve any problem and in most cases are only motivated by greed for comfort, circling back to the same issues as the representative leaders of the olden days.

One such incident starts the cascading effect of the sub group or whole group falling further and further into the rabbit hole of manipulation via misinterpretation having no control on the speed other than clinging on to the gaps of egos, accentuating this desperation of being afraid as actual rules and developing them as constraints—> an eternal fall while repeating the same mistakes.

It's not all bad as we also have personalities taking on the role of guides in all walks of life and unlike "saviours," guides try to make the best of any given system having found some balance between theory, interpretation and experiments.

An anomaly and a driving factor in all of this is the formation of Mob Groups that hold absolutely no power or purpose of their own but have only strength in numbers—> modern day mercenaries. Based on socio economic, religious or interest in random prejudice, working mostly without any humanistic merit, these Mob Groups are used by financially or politically minded elite interpreters to social engineer situations in their own favour by means of gossip as entertainment and various shadow reward schemes. Not classifying under right, centre or left but a general mechanism which has recently spread and gained strength due to rise of group chat applications like WhatsApp or Telegram or Signal etc—> making it easier to spread rumours or prejudice taking advantage of different demographic factors.

Not critiquing the technology itself because again, there are people using the same tools for the good of society but even they have to indulge with the menace of social engineering in some capacity for survival. Am I trying to disregard any form of emotions? Not at all, envy can also be used for self focused positive actions—> having negative emotions is part of being human but to spread that feeling through a collective mob is deplorable behaviour. It's again circling back to the point of out sourcing our sensibilities for immediate rewards while disregarding the vicious long term effects of such malpractice.

Circling back is to be cognisant that much of the same issues keep reappearing in different masks throughout history. We need to keep refining current structures and also build better ones from the onset in case of new technologies while keeping it light, real and fun for all.

In the olden times, before chat apps or internet forums, it would take actual leadership skills including proper communication to physically find and induct participants based on character screening as a constant exchange of person to person sensory data before transaction of relevant rewards. Therefore, a better orientation process for all sides, unlike rampant gossip based transaction of likes, reposts and boosting each others profiles on social media being the only criteria of today's screening process of lifting people out of assumed voids.

This is not to say that mob groups formed in the olden times or still working with old ways only indulge in noble pursuits, not at all, we know better than that from history. However, these groups had a common cause at least, were less susceptible to misinformation and influence. But could be equally or more biased since having less information/ data does not mean your analytical skills as an individual or a group are better or worse. Maybe, it was the slowness of communication and movement having limited means of transaction that contributed to only institutionalized participation. Not talking about random mob groups built out of sheer boredom or from the need of getting drunk for free—> it's pointless to even try to "analyse" their origin.

Some of these groups may not even be formed with the intention of becoming mobs and consider themselves sophisticated elites but slowly drifting or not even realizing initially of their activities being influenced by shady interpreters with ulterior motives for social or financial gains. In fact, these might be the most corrosive kind of mob groups because of their presence in specific institutions that could lead to significant long and short term side effects. For example—> employees of some franchise or those working in the same domain, students with lack of purpose or clarity could be the easiest targets of those building mob groups.

There's an old saying that the mob has no brain of its own, well…..The mob does not have any heart either. Its life experience is shallow and now it has been given unlimited agency to hide and fight pseudo battles from behind the shields of black mirrors.

Feel free to use aspects of the above analysis on yourself if applicable but its mostly applicable to mob groups spreading misinformation as gossip and not for groups being used for organization of positive work or activities. No, there’s nothing wrong with light hearted gossip until intentionally used as a tool of social engineering.

This mob phenomenon has nothing to do with maintaining the social fabric, these kind of activities are anti thesis to constructive progress and technology will evolve to provide a mechanism of balance but that won't be enough as the most important counter measure against this menace of corrosive social engineering is to promote kindness of humanistic values—> freedom of choice as granted to citizens of every country by their respective constitution.

Maybe, there are countries where the constitution is not based on democratic or humanistic values therefore not even on the path to a sustainable system—> forced or rapid change might not be the answer for preservation of life but positive interaction and constant effort providing a solution for self reform is essential.

We need to constantly remind ourselves that a healthy society is where we can co exist, work, respect and share joy with those who might not share all of our insecurities or lifestyle but continue to thrive for internal balance without imposing on others—> because this is something worth celebrating 🥳
