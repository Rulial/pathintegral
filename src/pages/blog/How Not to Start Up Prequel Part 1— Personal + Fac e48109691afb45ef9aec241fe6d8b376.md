November 2008, I was on a bus in London, heading towards 'Chase Imagination,' an animation studio in White Chapel. I was going for a part-time job as a runner/match move artist. It was a much-needed break, as I had been struggling with money, even though it had only been a month and a half since I moved to the UK for post-graduation. Plus, it was a whole new country, and making good connections would be helpful when I was allowed to work full time.

Detour—>

Before that, I was working at a VFX company in Mumbai as a Sequence Supervisor. Judging by their reaction itself, seemed like I shouldn't have any problem finding a job. I had no intention of disturbing their business model, but wanted to progress in my career.

Prashant Buyyala, the studio head from LA, came to the cafe during breakfast and sat on the chair right in front of me with a purpose. I had been emailing him for months to help make this animated short film, but it was not about that. Obviously, he knew I was leaving. He even had a whole pitch about it being too early in my career and that I should spend a couple more years here, along with a potential admission at Stanford University in the future. I respected Prashant, and it meant a lot coming from him back then. He was probably right as well, but I remember thinking, “astronauts don't hold on to the shore just because it's scary out there.”

Pascal Chappuis, the show supervisor originally from France, who was posted in Mumbai via LA, told me about Prashant taking this personally and being really angry for not following his advice. I emailed Prashant, asking him not to take this personally and tried to assure him that I didn’t have intentions of working as a 'Lighting Technical Director', but to make movies. He never replied. There was also some pressure from the family to leave the job for the UK, but I never cared about pressures.

Back to the future—>

Upon reaching the location, I met Jonathan Klahr/ JK, the head compositor and producer of the independent film 'Pixel', which features a giant spider-like creature—> JK had assumed from our email correspondence that I was based in New York or a similar location, and was surprised to learn that I had been working in Mumbai, India. They assigned me compositing duties, but were using an old software called 'Shake'. I had never used this software before, as RnH had a proprietary pipeline with their own software. Although I could find some similarities in the node-based UI, it takes time to understand all the nuances and intricacies.

Just re-read some emails from back then; apparently, I did well even with limited knowledge of Shake on that first day and provided them with useful information for creature and character compositing. They didn't even know about Occlusion or subsurface scattering. I recall JK was not in a position to help financially for that film; otherwise, it wouldn't have taken more than 2 paid weeks at the White Chapel Studio to get a hang of Shake. But that was apparently not an option because the studio was not producing Pixel, and the difficulty of sitting in front of a computer while starving can't be explained in words.

There were other meetings in London, but I didn't have money for frequent travel to the city, and made that clear. JK had shared some contacts and helped set my rate at GBP 150 to 200 based on experience, but almost no one replied, and those who did never followed up. He even wanted to send me Pixel's footage on disks so I could work at home, but I didn't have any setup or Shake installed on that laptop. Again, the problem of having no money for even basic amenities arose. Despite these challenges, I was still bestowed with the Sr Compositor credit on that short film and attended its screening in 2010 at the Curzon Cinema in Leicester Square.

October 2009

Just finished a one-year postgraduate program in film and television production, despite not having an undergraduate degree. The visa is still valid until February 2010. By the way, admission was granted based on complete honesty.

The past year had been really difficult. Although I didn't contract malaria or malaria + jaundice like in 2007 and 2008 respectively while working in Mumbai, pretty much spent the whole year starving without any job or much allowance money. I watched "The Pianist" with Adrien Brody, even though his circumstances were dire for entirely different reasons, I could still somewhat relate to him.

There was no logical explanation for my desperate situation because I was already skilled even before getting into this post graduate program and it seemed odd that no one wanted to use the talent to say the least. Saving the details for my book “Learning to Laugh about nothing.”

Around July 2009

To give you an idea of how bad things were, I had to turn down an invitation for a meeting at the last minute to check out some cutting-edge emerging tech for the purpose of the dissertation, but you never know what other opportunities might have opened up. Just because I didn’t have any money to take public transport from London to South Surrey. I was angry in that moment and disappointed in general; I lost all interest in writing the dissertation.

Right after that incident, I applied for a job at Dreamworks Dedicated Unit/DDU in Bengaluru through a kind friend and colleague at the previous job in Mumbai. Well, the location hardly mattered. I wanted to get back on the bandwagon. The plan was to take the year to fix the financial situation while completing the dissertation properly rather than rush it in 2 to 3 months, as there was a provision for delayed submission, and also because it was an interesting topic with future implications: "Effects of technology on the future of storytelling."

So, I traveled all the way from London to Bengaluru via a train journey from Delhi to Mumbai and a 13-hour bus journey from Mumbai to Bengaluru for that interview, thinking there’s no way I won’t get this job. I was working in a technical role before, and I am overqualified with this MA in producing. But apparently, I stuttered once during the interview, because of which and certain unknown factors, they declined to offer the position. That was a real bummer, but it had me refocus on the projects and writing.

My accommodation situation was changing; it was still going to be in Ilford but in Zone 4 rather than Zone 5 through some vague contact of my father. Before making this switch, I was staying with a very distant relative connected to my mother’s elder sister—Mani or Money or Moni? Not sure, don’t care. One day he asks me, “Are you here to make money or work?” Weird question. Can’t you make money by working?! Are the two things exclusive?! He had no idea about anything I was working on but had a PhD in being judgmental. Maybe you can get me a paid internship at PwC rather than me working at Tesco? That never came up. My food situation had improved slightly upon moving in with him, though it was still not ideal and far from being perfect. I did not really have money for a haircut, which really bothered him. As the day I got my head trimmed with a grade 1 razor, he was parading me outside his home as we took a walk on the street for the first time. I am sure there were things about me that were genuinely bothering him, but I can’t do anything if he was not going to speak to me about it directly! The ones we spoke about were all addressed.

Detour—>

Here’s a little story of a relative visiting London for a work meeting during that time—Uncle’s eldest daughter Poma didi’s husband, Mohit Ji. This is the point where I advise you to watch ‘Hum Apke Hai Kaun’ to get a hang of Indian relationships and their protocols. Mohit Ji is your ideal son-in-law, totally tip-top, at least on the facade level. Anyway, it had been a few months, and I was excited to see a familiar face. I didn’t know what he was expecting, but he ended up paying for dinner, which was apparently in violation of the relationship protocols and a huge controversy within the family. I never asked him for money or anything. Let’s say, even if I was not under the circumstances described here, I was still at university…whatever, whatever, even on that night, I could have paid, but the next couple of weeks would have been difficult. Anyway, never again did I go to any dinner and not at least pay for myself. There will be more in the book, obviously.

Money/Mani wanted to fit in, fine. The majority of people are like that, I get it, but you gotta leave space for the people who don’t have to fit in but make things happen and are capable of doing their thing. There were so many bank holidays while I was there, but I was not used to taking holidays! Still 22 years old, hello?! I made a casual comment—“people are not that hardworking here in comparison to America.” He took real offense to that. Well, I am sure you are shoveling through the money pile at PWC.

We connected on Facebook; it's early 2010, so I might have clicked on some of his photos to check out some cute girl. Again, I am only 22 years old at this time. Maybe that’s his relative, I don’t know. I don’t care. I invited him to the screening of my “graduation films” at Tibo’s Bar because high order thought that would be more exotic rather than conducting it in the college building for some reason. Anyway, Mani/Money accepted the invite and himself said that he would bring this girl, which was again weird. I don’t remember her name and didn’t really want her there because it was an intimate function with known guests. Laura was already going to be there showing her film, so I was not interested, but he never showed up! Good, though still weird. The whole stay was weird.

Regular Programming—>

Even though I did not get the job, I got the interview pretty easily at DDU. It makes one wonder why I couldn’t get even a proper interview during that year in the UK?! No, I was not looking to break the rules; you could work 20 hours/week and full time after the course had finished in September. I was only looking to get into VFX or film companies based on my skills and experience. Let me tell you why —> It’s fine if you are brown and ambitious coming from within that system, but it’s not alright when you are not one of “their own.” Not saying I am a victim of anything, but it’s just a fact. I heard something or other racist more than 100 times but ignored or joked about it —> It’s a disease of the mind to think that if someone is an immigrant and not rich then they are looking to take advantage of the system. I never took even 1 penny from their social security and never used the NHS. Largely what I earned during that time was spent on projects there itself or on consumables + expenses other than some money sent home.

During the study year, I pretty much tried for any job under the sun after being turned down for the desired roles. But, but, just because I was desperate, didn’t mean I gave up on ambition. My friend and I were trying to make a live-action short film titled ‘Marty Unplugged’ pretty much out of the hot farts coming out of our ass because of having no money. I was also trying to schmooze anyone who could invest in my global cinematic ideas which leads one to meet pretty shady people, other than being in touch with ‘Phil Captain 3d’ from Dreamworks and Chase Imagination for an altogether different animated short film ‘Phil Was There’ for trying to push the envelope.

For "Marty Unplugged," we were going to use the only thing we had complete access to at that time —> the art and media centre building belonging to the University of London. The idea for the film came from my fascination with music, spotting some Iskcon Devotees through the same building’s window, and shadowing a pretty high ‘one-man band’ busking on the streets of London. Every performance of Mr. Lewis Floyd Henry busking was like a cinematic experience in itself. Some would say it’s resourcefulness to bring all of those elements together.

Anyway, I also applied to a job looking for a 3D Max operator on [Mandy.com](http://mandy.com/) although I considered that way below my pay grade even at that time. Last time I had used ‘3D Max’ properly was in the Q1 of 2007 with no intentions of using it again. I had graduated to Hollywood from that point onwards, as far as I was concerned 🤷🏾‍♂️.

Got a brief reply from someone named Jim arranging a meeting with Jake. I didn’t know if there was really a Jim or not, but I soon discovered the magic of entrepreneurship in the following months. At 22 years old, I had plenty of energy to somehow make my way to the edges of Central London from Ilford in Greater London, either by foot or by taking occasional buses. The job was in Lancaster Gate, a part of town I had never visited before, and little did I realize that much of my life was about to revolve around this place.

The meeting was strange; Jake seemed like an interesting person who didn’t know much technically but seemed well-connected, which is what I was looking for at that point. Whatever or whoever I mentioned in the meeting, Jake always seemed to have a bigger and better version ready. I didn’t care that he was paying me the salary of a glorified intern; it was a paid gig, and perhaps I could have convinced him to invest or help with all the great stuff I was doing.

The next three months were pretty wild. Even a short film production is quite hectic when you're aiming to do things professionally, as myself and Luke Deller were. We even hired a sort of production assistant, Magdalena Sadowska, originally from Poland, who seemed like a character from a movie in her own right. She couldn’t make it to the first interview because of the weirdest but most honest reason I had ever heard, and that’s exactly why I hired her.

We were definitely over-hiring for a short film based in one location, as we also brought on a line producer to handle locations and police permits. Sahil Maniktala, now a ripped journalist but fat and lazy back then, was not sure if he even did anything or was there solely for Luke’s comfort. Lol. Just kidding, he was a pleasant addition with no passion for filmmaking. Lol. We only had money to pay the actual crew, and everyone else was working because of their passion for filmmaking.

Not to turn this into the longest essay ever, I was juggling four things alongside at this point: the dissertation, ‘Marty Unplugged,’ ‘Phil Was There,’ and the job. I was also writing other things in my spare time and had put a couple of other projects on the back burner, like ‘Pale Blue Dot’—> a drama about a kid in Iraq wanting to become an astronaut. This was first based in India, then Afghanistan, but I thought it would be more globally appealing if set in Iraq. It even won some internal competition arranged by the MA program as a vote of confidence, although no one engaged any further to help make it for some reason. All the projects were connected, and there could have been potential tie-ins. For the purpose of this essay, we will mainly concentrate on the job.

I was called into Creation Film and Television, based in a one-bedroom apartment, by Jake. There were three other people stationed in the office initially, while a couple of others kept coming in and out. I was thrown into the void without an introduction to anyone and told to turn 2D stuff into 3D with a magic wand. I had been doing research to make animated films with 3D depth because of ‘Phil Was There,’ and most of my exchange with Captain 3D was regarding that, but I had no clue about 2D to 3D conversion. That apartment was pretty much the Wild West.

There was a computer and some random instructions, but not much else. I remember thinking, "WTF did I get myself into?!" And it always comes with inner laughter 🤣. On the computer next to me was an equally confused person, but unlike myself, Atyeb was from Pakistan. That was another surprise because even though London has people from all around the world, I hadn't thought about working alongside someone from that country. Both of us were a little apprehensive while trying to figure out the dynamics. He even asked me once, “bhaijaan, aap mujhse nafrat karte hain?” lol. I told him that I have no reason to hate you, don’t believe the lies your government has fed you, and as Indian citizens abroad, it is our duty to spread love and kindness rather than political rhetoric.

The other two guys were Tom, Caribbean British, and Reggie, British Indian. Reggie once threatened to break my head because of a random sarcastic joke lol. Jake was a Brit raised in Hong Kong with an American accent; you couldn't pinpoint exactly what he was about, but he was kinda cool dude, a failed actor with his most prominent role as an Air Hostess in a James Bond movie. I would end up meeting a lot of people with some connection to James Bond movies 🤷🏾‍♂️.

Tom and Reggie told us that the company was predominantly an editing facility, putting out DVDs of all kinds until one day Jake told them that they were going to do 2D to 3D conversion. Just like that. In the early days, we were trying to figure out everything from scratch, even though Jake had another consultant involved who, again, was a nice guy but always intoxicated and not completely sure of his proposed method.

I had also proposed a method after some technical research and a brief consultation with Captain 3D to generate depth maps in Nuke itself without building the geometry in 3D's Max, while Atyeb was working on making sense of the instructions from the consultant and the internet.

My method involved some R&D as not only did this require learning Nuke inside out, but also writing custom Python scripts. After a while, mostly the whole industry had moved to generating depth maps from rotos only for the conversion, so I was on the right path, but it was rejected in favor of the proven and easy method at that time.

From my time working at Rhythm and Hues, my mind was already accustomed to thinking in terms of pipelines and systems, but I couldn't care less if they were going to go their own way. I used to frequently step out for meetings for the short films with Jake in the loop and would cover up the time by working odd hours. He was extremely understanding and helpful in that way, even though I found the rest of his communication about the projects less than satisfying. It wasn't just me; everyone in the office had that issue. However, we all liked Jake because he was kind and made you feel like one of the guys, but he also had a major god complex about looking like he knows everything—> he didn’t want to appear vulnerable and was really protective of his boss image, even when valid feedback was shared.

We started working as a test on a movie called Toolbox to make it into Toolbox 3D. It took me a while to figure out that the old man frequently visiting the office, always on the verge of being stressed out yet maintaining relative calm, was Jake’s father—> Mike! Jake would use his first name for whatever reasons rather than calling him dad, papa, or father. I never saw his mom, though I heard them mention her a few times. A couple of people disappeared after only one sighting, but one of them became a permanent fixture around the office—> Peter Ropner. He was a finance guy and pretty much useless to our work, along with being the one with the most problems about my arrangement of multilateral functioning.

The next two years of my life revolved around these people amidst all this confusion and strange dynamics due to a lack of trust. It's a shame because you lose a lot of time in your life by spending 2 <—> 2 years like this, only to suddenly realize that it’s been a decade. Therefore, it's important to not repeat learned lessons.

We were able to make Marty Unplugged with Luke getting about GBP 750 from his girlfriend’s grandmother at that time—> that’s what I was told anyway. Because I had just gotten this job, I promised to help him pay it back so he wouldn't lose favor with the in-laws 🤯, though I personally did not take any money from that and was paying for all my own expenses even before getting the job. There was also a failed fundraising attempt in a pub, which is more like a ritual if you are making an independent film in England and almost always ends in disappointment. Somehow we were able to pull it off, along with me putting in money by taking an advance from Jake—> I specifically remember buying the hard drives along with some other equipment for approximately GBP 500 while also contributing to a few other things.

Once the principal photography for the film was finished, I could concentrate on making Toolbox into 3D, realizing I had some catching up to do as Atyeb was chirping along. But I had another concern—> Luke went completely AWOL after the production, not a message, not a phone call, nothing. He just disappeared. Now, I had second thoughts about having cared for his favor because he was not my girlfriend but a business partner and can’t just disappear like that for months. A girlfriend should definitely not do that because it’s really stressful ☹️🥺.

I had the hard drive with the footage and assumed Luke did not exist. The thing about making a film is not only about making that film but using it to make the next one, and I was instantly in that mode. You want to build and leverage relationships, but some people had a problem with that as well because they did not understand the business of making a short film. There’s no chance of earning money, so you use it that way! Involve people, show how amazing this short film is so you can make the next one. Other than trying to finish that film, my focus was on getting ‘Phil Was There’ made in its best version, which meant proper funding. For example, it’s the end of October and getting cold; I need to keep warm and yet attend meetings with limited finances. I bought a business coat supposed to be warm enough but barely keeping me warm on its own, whatever. It was predominantly a functional decision and not a “status-seeking expense.”

Hired an experienced editor in a Miss. Merethe Rosvold, originally from Norway but who had been working for many years in London. She was totally awesome and made the film better with her skills, like a wonderful shot composited around the bus and the busking crowd. She edited it as per the script, so it’s not her fault that I edited it down to half the original timeline. She was only following instructions regarding the runtime, and it was a learning curve for both of us editing a narrative film on our own. She didn't take any money either but was a top-class communicator. We went to a bar upon delivery to celebrate by getting a bit drunk. I was really tight on money as always lol, she knew and didn’t drink much. No, I did not fall in love, but I liked and appreciated her as a person to this day.

Some people in conversation about ‘Phil Was There’ argued that I should make it completely on my own sitting at a computer. I was happy to do that if someone was going to fund the production, i.e., pay for my time. But I also know my strengths and weaknesses well enough to understand where I need to hire people for animating the characters. I could direct it end-to-end while taking on technical, aesthetic, and managerial responsibilities, but I wouldn't waste time or resources by insisting on doing everything due to ego. It was quite unreasonable of them, knowing I had next to no money, while also not understanding the scope of the production itself.

There were strange incidents along the way at Creation Film and Television. Once, Jake accused me of clogging the toilets, but I was pretty sure it was him as I had seen him going in that day, and I had not been to the toilets the whole day! lol. But this one has to be the best—> the landlord had a problem with us playing loud music; almost everyone was humourless apparently. The next day, they had the whole office evacuated at midnight while I was not even there. I rang the bell in the morning to hear Useless Ropner calling me out from the Deli opposite the building complex, with Jake sitting alongside. It was pretty funny. We shifted to the basement of the Sri Lankan real estate agent who had sublet that apartment to Jake, which apparently he was not supposed to do. Shouldn’t Peter have been looking into that problem beforehand? I mean, what else was he doing?! Make yourself useful.

They let me go at the end of the three month period with the project already finished; I had done my work, and they did not have a real order yet. At this time, my only hope for fulfilling the financial conditions to transfer and extend my visa from student to a two year work permit was getting funding for ‘Phil Was There,’ so I was concentrating on that while trying to finish ‘Marty Unplugged’ all on the saved money from the job, which was not much.

I got myself involved in another project in the meanwhile, talks for which had been going on for a while to supervise the VFX for free but also to get the VFX done for free. The director, Peter from Chez, was a nice guy; he gave me his DSLR camera to run some tests before the shoot and for doing stills photography during the shoot—> like to make myself useful. One of my friends was working in an Ilford Fried Chicken shop; I used to hang out there after hours. On this evening coming back from one of those long walks, I placed the backpack on the side slab with Peter’s camera inside while I was eating fries, but the bag just fell face down on the floor, and to my horror, the casing of the lens attached to the camera was broken. I found the courage to tell Peter and promised to pay him for the damage—> I paid him GBP 100 in December 2010.

Regarding the production—> I had some ideas which I shared with them, but there was no promise because they wanted a real dragon in the movie, and it was not like I had a setup ready, with it being only about allocating time. I had nothing with a film of my own, finding it hard to post-produce without any money and a missing producer. I was still not getting any interviews for whatever reasons.

At 22 years old, I was taking a lot of initiative and showing creativity, so much hustle and business sense, finding use cases for emerging tech in the context and whatnot while having nothing on me, getting almost no help or appreciation but a lot of scrutiny for not having any money. Yeah! Of course, What do you expect?! All this happened within six months from September 2009 to February 2010, within 1.4 years of leaving the previous job in October 2008. I will describe the time during the actual MA in the book.

With Jake and Creation film in the background, the focus had shifted to Chase Imagination for Phil Was There, as I realized they did not have much going on other than some small and casual projects. But Darren and the team had good aesthetics—> seemed like we could work together.

Detour—>

Got a call from Alexey Tonkikh, my Russian friend also from the post graduation asking for help him with his short film. He had helped many times during this period, didn’t ask him for cash as many times as Tibo but he did pay for many of my meals. The best thing he did was introduced me to the local Hare Krishna temple and adjoining Gopala restaurant in Soho—> those were some of the best and satisfying meals I have had. Growing up in a Hindu family, temples were part of the general discourse, but also in India, Iskcon always had this image of being a foreign organisation and some of the things can feel a bit over the top to a native which is no judgment on the people practicing their chosen faith. As far as I am concerned, my Hindu faith is not an identity issue but something that gives you strength to find your identity out there instead of showing off. I grew up listening and watching Ramayan and Mahabharta, like I said, it’s all part of the regular discourse but people at Iskcon being over excited about these things was a little awkward.

Anyway, this was right after I saw Alexey in the morning before starting to film Marty Unplugged at the college building. He felt a bit left out but he always felt a bit left out and thats something he needed to work on himself because it’s not up to the rest to make him feel included. He had over the top ideas about remaking Mahabharta or even generally without having much sensibilities re the markets, industry or the craft itself. I did try to be honest with him sometimes but it’s difficult when someone is not connected to the ground truth. Just as an example—> he emailed Lenny Henry, an awesome black British comedian but unsuitable to write and star in a potential Mahabharata like epic, but based around some fantastical version of his own self after we met Lenny during a retreat. 

Explain this—>

“Oh but you were pitching all kinds of ideas to people as well?” I tried pitching a VFX heavy original idea like “Rural Olympics” knowing ins and outs of the whole pipeline to save production costs—> that was my whole pitch that people are making action based stuff like this for $300 million but we can make something similar for $30 mil based on diverse market dynamics, so the later figure might sound absurd without the context. Also, I did not approach Ricky Gervais to play the lead but also write that action heavy movie based in Punjab, India! All the projects I had been pitching were original and based on my relative position to the market whether a third person with limited knowledge understood that or not is a different matter altogether. On the direction side I was pushing an affordable independent film like ‘Miss Z’ but on the producing side ‘Bloody London’ which had others involved even though originally it was brought to me as a short film director. ‘Phil Was There’ was an animated short with branding play based on my own script that I was perfectly equipped to handle.

Before being confident about writing feature film scripts myself, I used to approach writers for collaboration on spec with upfront details about the said proposal—> thats why I used to have anyone sign non disclosure and confidentiality agreements.

Back to the detour—>

I arrived to a one bed apartment where Alexey was trying to convince his young DOP friend about not giving up on almost everything. I also did my best and finally we were able to convince the young man even if I had to put myself down in the process. We slept in sleeping bags and went to the location in the morning, like this guy suddenly gained confidence in his dreams. I was enjoying all this, liked being on any kind of shoot and Alexey was pleasant to be around.

There were also two women with us, one the director and other an actress, both named Ksenia. I have to add that the actress Ksenia was one of the most beautiful women like ever, deep blue transparent eyes and all you know, even though I had met some women by now. But being a professional and having no money to ask her out, where would I take her with a fiver in my pocket?! Remember meeting her again during a function doing still photography for Alexey. Last time I spoke to her was on Instagram to complain about Anna but she is married and moved to chile 🤷🏽‍♂️

The shoot itself was just what it was like me babysitting these people and trying to give confidence to this young DOP by making myself look inadequate. It’s all part of trying to get things done. They felt exactly like that as well. lol.

Before leaving for the interview at DDU in Bangalore, Alexey and his friend Ivan gave me a job to distribute flyers for their new Yoga studio. I took it but instead of going from apartment to apartment in a few buildings I might have left a bunch of them in the common areas for people to help themselves. I did go all around Soho and Tottenham Court Road area but I was appointed only as a flyer distributor, not a sales person. What did you want me to do?! Give demonstration of madhur asana to each and every person on the street while shoving the flyer up theirs?! Ivan was really testy about my flying performance. Not much zen like. Whatever, i hope the inhale exhale inhale venture was a success.

Back to regular programming—>

Started frequenting to Chase Imagination’s basement studio in Whitechapel though was not being paid because it was my own project and we were looking for funding. Still on saved money from Jake’s. One of these days I was asked to attend a meeting for a project titled ‘Bloody London’ an anthology horror film, there were about 12 people in attendance, all somewhat accomplished but none well known. They wanted me to direct one of the short films in the anthology! Felt grateful for being considered and for the opportunity but even this project has no funding or structure or a set premise other than a basic idea. Still, it was exciting so I started working on this in addition to everything else.

But finally, I got an interview call and that too from Partizan based in Soho, for those who don’t know its a production company owned by Michel Gondry, director of ‘Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind’ one of my favourite movies. The interview went well, they wanted some 2d to 3d conversation and by this time I was up to speed if not ahead—> it was all but final though I had not received a contract yet. They wanted me to start on freelance basis in mid December. The rate was GBP 200 per day, it was much higher than what Jake was paying and also appropriate for the work, finally! The only people I had told about this were my mom and JK, an acquaintance who I had helped earlier that year with his independent film and who had introduced me to Darren—> they felt like a good support, much older but interesting.

In the meantime, another issue came up! My brother was getting married and they insisted I attend. Even though had told them that I have no money for the ticket and it does not matter, I am starting this job soon and will have to come there in Feb to renew the visa, so we will meet and celebrate then but they insisted to the point of booking the tickets. Double checked with Partizan if it’s alright as I will be back before we are supposed to start and was told to carry on.

Went to the wedding, danced, it was what it was, there was a robbery during Tikka ceremony with all that Fufaji and Tauji drama which comes around with it but let’s keep all those juicy details for the book 😁.

Travelled back to London being excited about finally starting a proper job, and of course, the first thing I did was email Partizan, but to no reply. Then my contact in between told me they had called it off, and no proper reason was shared. Another bummer—> JK was working at Partizan within a few weeks of this incident.

In btw, me and JK were sitting at a pub, he told me about Jit/ Jitender, the Gujarati partner at Chase Imagination and how he secretly drives a Bentley while claiming to have no money to invest in the business. Maybe, he thought all immigrants are secretly rich like Jet. IDK.

I did get another job for one day only at the rate of GBP 250. It was about putting some 3D geometries together in Nuke, which they wanted to use for projection mapping. I did as much as I could in one day, which required asking for a lot of assets from another compositor sitting alongside but not doing much because he was unhappy and wanted to leave as it was Christmas Eve. That money somehow got me through the holiday period.

What I should have done now was learned Nuke inside out, as till now I only learned enough for 2D to 3D conversions. Like already mentioned, all the VFX expertise I had built was on Rhythm and Hues' proprietary pipeline and code, so outside of it, on third-party software, I knew the technical hijinks but not the software UI itself—> gap. Also, after directing a couple of short films in the past year, I was pretty confident in my skills and could not understand why I needed to be a computer freak again when the world is waiting to witness my creative genius as a film director! Yes, I was naive. lol.

There was also this thing where if a film executive knew about your technical chops, they would consider you less of a director at that time. Therefore, I decided to play down my knowledge of tech in general and started exploring the bird, bees and the flowers. You can be a really good writer and good at tech but can’t do both at the same time. If I found a technique to tune in/out then it could work for myself but not from a third persons perspective.

Luke had resurfaced by now and post production for Marty Unplugged had reached colour grading stage. I did not have the equipment to colour grade it myself and also wanted the best output possible. Got in touch with the finest and they accepted to help for the passion realising I had no money. We still had to arrange the equipment for them to colour grade, could not use Jake’s facility for some reason, therefore, arranged the session at Chase Imagination but it was all embarrassing because the machines there were not adequate to handle professional colour grading. We were disappointed to find an experienced person and not being able to make use of his talent. Anyway, he was paid gas money and respectfully seen off.

I was trying to pitch all the projects I had written to anyone who would listen. Jake would call me in for work some times, helped them move into a new basement office prior to the colour grading thing and even used his facility to edit Marty Unplugged for one day with Merethe, the editor—> we had to jump the gate because Jake was worried about us nicking his equipment. lol. .

I pitched the idea of making Phil Was There for London 2012 Olympics to Darren via JK who found it appealing and we drafted an email to the head of the Olympics Media committee—> did not get a reply straightaway, still, we were more than hopeful and started looking for concept artists to get ourselves in a strong position for a presentation whenever required. I posted a job opening on [Mandy.com](http://Mandy.com) and bunch of artist replied with samples but we liked work of one Candice Purwin based in Germany but originally from Britain itself.

One thing to notice here—> even though I could not get introduction to the needle movers, i kept running into people like Jonathan Klahr, Darren and Jake who wanted to build things and recognised the same passion even if they could not commit to nurture it due to reasons of their own. Had to take some monetary help from Jonathan Klahr of GBP 200 that I paid back later that year in full in 2010.

By now we got one reply from the head of Olympics media committee to build hope but that’s all while Candice had uprooted her whole life from Germany to London for this project. I could not understand why Darren and co which included a super rich gujju bhai were not trying other avenues of funding. Maybe, they did not understand the business model? Didn’t want to offend them either so as to not burn the bridges. At the same time, had to literally walk from Illford to their studio every other day in ankle deep snow in the same business coat but was more worried about having to answer Candice because I make people give everything they have and not being able to pay them in exchange was ridiculous. In the meanwhile, I was doing everything I could, like building a rough set design in 3ds max and contacting studios in India for quotation for readiness if funding becomes available somehow.

Just because my communication was professional and clear, people thought I also had some secret source of generating money but I didn’t! All the while, Feb was approaching and I was helpless. Jake gave me some work on the last day before leaving and for a while even when I was in India, therefore, had money in my pocket.

Back in India but all those problems remained. The money earned from Jake was being spent on expenses and to finish ‘Marty Unplugged’ as could have still got out of this hole if that turned out well. Tried everything I could to get the film graded properly in Mumbai but everyone was of the view that a movie with foreigners should have funds, I don’t know. Dry hired an editing facility in Mumbai to colour grade it but it was not equipped to deal with raw footage from the red cameras, most of the time was spent in installing plugins etc. But while leaving the studio in the evening I saw Katrina Kaif in a car being chased by the Paparazzi, so that made me feel slightly better.

In the end, had to put together the most vulnerable setup to grade and render the output but also transfer the footage via the sloppy internet of those times for Luke to have its first public screening which I was obviously not able to attend. My laptop could hardly handle Nuke which I used to grade at that time and had somehow hooked Adobe Premier on a really old desktop to make it all work. We used the volcano eruption in Iceland as an excuse for my non presence at the screening 🤣. The feedback was positive but we just did not have the money to send it to enough festivals—> was not satisfied and kept editing it to bring the timeline from 14 minutes to approx 8 minutes. Jake had stopped sending work by now.

Dorothy, one of the producer for the short film which required VFX had kindly given me £100 to help with the travel and I really wanted to get the dragon VFX done. She was really nice to me through out the shoot as well, along with all the actors including child actor and their guardians, even though some people’s didn’t like me being around the set because apparently I was taking too much attention! lol. I like to help! and there was not enough to do!

This led me to an Animation Institute in Noida; I remember being ridden there by Raju Bhaiya, a cousin from Assam as his office was nearby and him saying—> “You would have done well in USA.” I was still only 23, had got a job contributing in Hollywood at 20 years old, did an MA for one year and was working on all these things. Don’t know what everyone was expecting?! 

Anyway, upon the first meeting with the animation institute, realised the facility was clueless about scaling the business or teaching the students to become the best at the craft. They were only interested in making quick money. I did shared my plan with them again but upon no proper response, did not get further involved.

Then visited couple of Gaming Companies in Mumbai to find synergies by connecting Jake’s business, Darren’s business or one of my other contacts but with zero resources it was all proving to be a bit daunting. I also did not have proper commitments from either Jake or Darren to pursue anything with authority or commitment of shares/profit, therefore, risk was all mine.

In fact, I introduced Jake to a Sid Jain who claimed to be producing Shekhar Kapoor’s ‘Water.’ I admired Shekhar and knew it would be a good project if he’s able to secure funding. Jake never properly communicated which I figured out later as much of his con man techniques are revealed in part 2.

Everyone i met was definitely reading too much into my weird accent which is a result of raw vocabulary before going to the UK and wanting to improve in every aspect of the craft. It was a side effect of trying to properly understand a language which i was using to write and not particularly to impress random people. Of course, you then try to use it sometimes to impress girls 🤷🏾‍♂️ and why not? It’s kind of exotic to speak in multiple languages and accents. You do need money to back up the accent though, just saying.

You gotta read this for a brief recollection of what happened in 2010 at 23 years old—>

[THE RAIN MAKERS—> Story + Personal](THE%20RAIN%20MAKERS%E2%80%94%20Story%20+%20Personal%20548a2785251144b3bf7cdb792eb7d0bf.md)

Upon reading all of this, who can say I didn’t throw the absolute kitchen sink of business development at 23 years old? Though with extremely limited finances. I didn’t even want to do sales at that time but make movies.

All of this activity also helps one gauge the market and realise how much you can stretch. What kind of people are involved in different domains, if they have any actual technical knowledge or sustainable plans for growth to make further moves or not.

Extra Bits—>

This happened during the MA program, but worth mentioning here. I didn’t pass accountancy paper in 12th grade by 1 mark. Didn’t interest me, never bothered to learn. Of course, as an adult it became simpler, i reluctantly did accounts for 9 years for Ash’s construction company. When I don’t like something, its a slow start, it’s about convincing the self to concentrate, but then I get exponentially better. Had not figured it out, yet.

Accounts was also a subject of the MA Producing curriculum, there was also an exam for it. Never bothered to prepare. 

I was looking but couldn’t find an accommodation in London, where the program was taught. Therefore, still living on main campus in Egham, Surrey. On the morning of the exam, took the train from Egham, Surrey to London, like i used to every morning. It was costly. 

The train stopped midway due to some malfunction, there was a delay of about 30 minutes. Only time it happened. A girl about my age was sitting beside, getting stressed because she also had an exam, but in Japanese language to qualify for something. 

I was not much bothered about my test, but she was really freaking out, because if she missed out then the next opportunity would be in a year or two. We decided to visit the station master to get a letter about the train being late, to convince our respective instructors to let us take the test. We ran, convinced the station master, got the letter. She looked slightly relived but still down. Never saw her again. I obviously failed that test. But, something interesting, thought I should share.

Appendix—>

Everything mentioned here is verifiable via document trail and emails. 

I realised it slowly that no one likes that I am shooting for the moon until I heard Will Smith talk about infringing on white privilege by even thinking of taking on the role of Superman. It’s not necessarily about race but status quo is present everywhere in different forms.

This idea that someone should be paid based on their age or experience only rather than their talent or skills is absolutely ignorant and stupid. What does my age has to do when I am pressing the same buttons but with more insight and aesthetic than some jabroni with less hair and more wrinkles?! I have faced this problem repeatedly, you can’t fight all the fights. “But you need to pay the dues.” Isn’t doing the work “paying the dues?” It’s envious people keep trying to pull you down and some times they succeed. 

“You were earning only Rs. 20000 in your previous job, yeah?!” Doing the same work as anyone else on that team but better, I was also finding both business model and technical problems that they were not even seeing and that’s why I left that job. Maybe, it was too rushed of a decision but my life sucked and I could see the sad trajectory all around. It’s a cultural things at some places to analyse value based on money earned by a person in previous job vs based on skills and talent. It’s the latter usually building better products and wins.

Events not mentioned here are being kept for the book which might not be exact recollection of reality.

Do I care anymore about any of this?—> No. It’s more like, stop saying lies about me and I will stop telling your truth.

Excuse the typos.
