There are different kind of entrepreneurs, the ones who run businesses and the ones who make rain—> something from absolutely nothing. It's a different kind of mindset, essential for making rain but not necessarily for rain water harvesting because its a high and to an individual addicted to this drug, every situation can feel like a zero sum game, only they can win.

It's 2010, last year of that decade, for some reason stakes seemed high, there were many options and opportunities though I could still feel the squeeze to make this happen. At the office of India's biggest media company founded by a person I had admired growing up and about to meet one of its top executives. This could be the moment it can all change for the better or for the worse…?

Let's go a little back in time…..90's, when I grew up, television was the main thing to get all your entertainment and India only had 2 major networks including the state controlled DoorDarshan.

My parents were both working professionals with a home office secluded towards one side of the house. I ended up spending a lot of time at home with my grandmother, along with being her personal technician, foot massager, shopping buddy, she would also share all kinds of stories.

The first time I heard about cats was about her cats back in the hood. First time I heard about outer space was a story re Shoemaker Comet from her while watching the news and then after adding bit of her own take, discussing it with our neighbouring didi—> she would also tell me about giving Rs.10 out of total Rs. 20 to "Respected Goatee" who in her words "ran away from our ancestral village to build this news channel we were watching as part of a massive Media Empire—> the only other major network in the country at that time"

For a kid, it sounded believable because my uncle/ Tauji was working there as a top executive. But also, she would with absolute confidence offer a job at that network to anyone struggling and did get a couple of them employed! 😃

I remember taking my uncle's visiting card to show the kids at school because they just didn’t believe me! But afterwards would ask me to change the network programming schedule to match their tuition timings 🙃

Later on, I would realise among many attributes embedded into my own psyche were from grandmother like non conformity to authority for the sake of it, independent thinking, responsibility, self dependence, fierceness, skepticism, nick naming everyone, respectfulness, forward thinking for women rights, no patience for bullshit….though, telling stories was probably the most prominent. I can give examples of each of those attributes though this story is not really about her. Should add that I caught attributes of dedication to a task including always first reading last page of a book…for some reason and telling detailed stories from my mum.

Maybe, telling fiction 😁 is also something I caught on from grandmother because never could confirm how much she gave to "SCG" before leaving the village but we will come to it later—> maybe someone can confirm or deny after reading this? Oh wait, that bit was a joke for the unassuming.

I got to meet "SCG" in person when I was like 14 at my cousin sisters wedding—> he was very enthusiastic and pleasantly surprised that we existed. This was also my first brush with bigger than life characters, he had like 5 or more people around him, sorry not just around but at his disposal but doing nothing in particular. I really looked up to him since that time itself, in some aspects he felt personally relatable 😭 I know that says something about me huh 🤷‍♂️

Anyway, it was important to tell that side of childhood to make sense for what's to come next. It's 2010, I had been working in VFX for a few years and just finished a program in Producing films—> burning with ideas though not much proper writing skills yet and everything else that comes with it. Pattern recognition was still there though. Rough.

I still had ideas before the VFX job and the producing degree but now I had the tools to package those concepts on paper at least with augmented technical chops—> that was the whole idea behind taking this path. In Bollywood at least, VFX was still being used as a novelty and not really to tell stories, which is still the case to a degree. Even though I had been extensively exposed to independent films and personally wanted to work on those type of projects. At the same time, mindset was on making big movies to find financial security, also because I had those kind of ideas which could be built into such projects.

Inspired by a lot of Hollywood and mythical stories from India, I had been developing this idea based around science fiction bullock carts and secret order of rural India for years—> started as a short animation and turned into a magnum opus on paper 😭😁 that's kinda my thing when come to think of it.

I never had the habit of sitting around with things and not hustling to make them…but how would I do that? Not Unless, you have a father who's equally or even more ambitious, he needs to hear about an opportunity to make big money and will do anything he can without even thinking, no that's not a joke, it's a compliment. He really does dive into things without much thought—> anything is possible! I feel obliged to mention something about my brother otherwise he would feel left out, that's his and his wife's thing, even if this has nothing to do with them 😭.

But good in this case, I told my father about this project and he himself recommended pitching to "SCG" and got me his email! He was definitely more enthusiastic about this whole thing, even told me about the sleeping patterns and schedule of "SCG"…..While I am a bit more self and reality aware—> knowing well enough they were not going to invest USD 30 Million straight away but it could be the start of something wonderful towards that vision. You gotta take your shots man 🤷‍♂️. Before anyone starts analogising with current projects…things are much different now, I was 23 years old.

The analysis behind pitching this project specifically to "SCG" other than having access was that most content at that time was template films which were increasingly stale. Netflix's web streaming era is still a few years away at that time.

This is the right time and a perfect opportunity to hit the nail—> think what Bahubali films did a few years later? Who knows, this could have been better or worse but in the same veins, the theory was legit. Even though not accelerating, this was still the biggest media company in India—> another point of contention, they were not doing anything exciting and that is a sin in entertainment.

Going down this route would have not only given them a content IP which would work across India but also abroad. That in itself would make them future ready but another important part of the proposal was to take their production capabilities several levels above from pillars to post—> that in addition to everything else would have allegedly put them in prime position for not only to compete but dominate the coming disruption with better content and not the usual assembly line template bullshit.

Decline in quality happens when you think of an entertainment company as only a money making company. No offense.

Why didn't I just approach "SCG" via my uncle even though he's best buddies with him? I never asked him for help this time or ever but he himself offered me GBP 2100 money to process the Visa to go away and chart my own course that same year—> which I still have to return with interest, there's your assurance 🙏. My uncle is like the Warren Buffet of Haryana but does not like to take risks on ideas or people other than those in the stock market 🤷‍♂️. He would joke about generating😉 candies out of a broken down vintage camera by putting sugar and water into it when I was 2-3 years old. I would take him seriously and try to repeat that process after he had left, to no use. Maybe, we can blame him for all this artistic mindset? 😎

Coming back to the thick of things—> I wrote the email and "SCG" replied within a few days! We had an appointment scheduled to meet at the Empire's headquarters in Mumbai with an executive.

As they say, the rest is history…not quite went that way 🤣. The meeting with the executive was like every meeting ever on earth…they will read the hard copies and revert back! The executive did seem a bit opinionated though in my head back then it was just too good to not discuss further. But I did not hear for a few weeks and patience was not my virtue at that time—> I had the visa processed and a half job to support my ambitions in London waiting if they were not going to reply.

Had waited enough, wrote an email reminding them about professionalism, which was obviously idiotic on my part and did burn the bridge. To learn and live to see another day…as they say.

I did try to recover the relationship again in a couple of years but it was all too much desperation on my part at this point and things were spiralling down like crazy to find any footing which is a thrilling page turner for another day.

Years later, I was back in Mumbai, living in a hotel. This time trying to sell genuine writing based projects and heard "SCG" had run into major financial problems. I genuinely had no thought of contacting him or his business on my own using that connection and it was highly improbable he would even reply. I was more of the view that it would be better to rekindle once I had made it on my own—> you know self worth kinda thing.

But then I thought—> hey, this is a good chance to help each other, things were not really working out for me either in terms of hitting that first goal post. Therefore, I swallowed the pill and wrote to some executives at the empire with absolutely no ref to our connection—> there was some shadow play happening but that's always the case so did not care. 

The executives were still unprofessional to say the least, I just did not understand how anyone can do any kind of business with such awful communication and total disregard for other people's time. Also, not reading the content sent to them which is their primary job. Even if, they deny it being their primary job because internal politics or external ass kissing for favours is a more favourable time pass. This is the case with everyone in the content media and another totally different essay.

Really tired of that shitty attitude at the Empire, both myself and my business partner finally decided to write to the "SCG." No reply received to that email till this day though I understood he was dealing with a lot of real shit. Deep down I was also trying to help, thinking this will benefit everyone as it takes only one hit series to shoot any platform into the stratosphere—> Stock 📈

After a few weeks we did receive a reply from the usual channel of executives and the result was more bad communication + entitled attitude. If you are not trying to purposefully sabotage a project then that’s how you do it. To add insult to injury, they even took inspiration from our material to make a series of their own. Not trying to prove that I was right by calling them unprofessional—> that was totally idiotic on my part but turns out…was still the truth.
