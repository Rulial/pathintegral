Love is not an obsession, it’s not an addiction, its empowerment of finally knowing your purpose, as all other goals mean little in comparison. Because, you can share it with another person, and the whole world.

The flights were all extremely expensive throughout this period. Like INR 125,000 or more. 

Anna was getting uneasy as it had been months waiting. Maybe, overthinking. But it was based on simple reasoning as stated above.

Show me the money—>

I had started doing research on funding Hex through tokenisation. There was no point in rushing into it, as the idea was not to somehow raise the money, but to provide value to the users.

Made a short visit to Mumbai in July. There were couple of work leads, I missed Bombay, and travelling + to get away from the negative environment of the household, as noted in previous issues. Found a cheap AIRBNB in Andheri East as the Urbanpod hotel was non operational. Here are some dumps—>

A fictional animated movie is a whole other thing, it essentially has nothing to do with a blockchain based economic model. I was already struggling with money, but have never been a desperate kind. There were plenty of diverse scams running around these ideas, and it was important to find the authenticity. 

A movie is also a very different entrepreneurial concept from tech or retail or trading or anything else. You have to make projections about revenue streams based on the strength of the world in the script, thats why traditional investors find it hard to understand the film business. All early associations like sales agents or development money is raised as a favour to the producer or known talent attached to the project—> thats why I even tried to approach Jake or Sanjay or Vani or Jan Nathanson to leverage their contacts. There are not “early adaptors” for a movie till it’s made as a finished film. 

To say that I am anti social is ridiculous when I am trying to get contacts from even 10 years ago involved in projects, people like Jake who had been spreading fake news about me. But Ashwin didn’t have anyone who he could bring onboard either, even for a conversation. Maybe, he didn’t want to introduce people he knew to me out of insecurities—> you can’t have that mindset when trying to make a dent.

I understood the science of crypto to its core from researching about Bitcoin for about 10 years to write about in ‘The Great Indian Rope Trick.’ There were plenty of times when people would say “let’s just mine bitcoins” including Rikhil Bahadur, why bother with the film?! The business of bitcoin mining is not exactly an end to end mechanism, and it never interested me because of being a really dicey slope, unlike bitcoin itself.

But, if not immediately for the film, I wanted to use my knowledge of blockchains to generate some form of revenue. I even asked Ash if he would be interested in building a NFT marketplace for real estate, not deeply thought out yet, but something to explore. Other than not wanting to invest upfront, he didn’t want to make me a partner in the business, but work for him! Not even paying anything. So, “what are you doing in this venture?” I asked him because the only role he could have had was investing. It was a non starter. 

Didn’t even float that idea with Akash or Pawan, as that would have lead to 10 meeting, and no conclusion. Again, I asked them to write a business plan for any idea we spoke about or pay me to write one, so they know what we are talking about, and follow through as required. But, they weren’t swell to that way of working either.

I was also talking to Surbhi about developing various projects, of course there was no funding at the moment. Especially, a fictional series on Mr. Vikram Sarabhai Jain, founder of the Indian space program. But then we saw the promo for ‘Rocket Boys’, even though our idea was quite different, it felt like a bummer.

Dad had another inquiry for Masks and gloves, we had to travel to Mumbai together. But these people knew someone also interested in buying Bitcoin. Well, they could have gone to one of the many crypto exchanges like everyone was buying it, but if not, I could definitely help them as a consultant to make purchase as per the laws.

The masks and gloves deal was being coordinated by a Javed bhai, and didn’t land anywhere. In fact, he was the one who arranged the Gagan Goyal thing in Delhi as well, and took some money from dad. We went out for dinner, and he was offended when we took him to a regular restaurant in Vile Parle, rather than “fine dining.” lol. I had inclination on this guy being shady from the beginning. 

Archit Sinha, a friend from the theatre days, now a reporter, and content creator was working in some capacity with WazirX, an Indian crypto exchange—> i asked him to make some introductions. He introduced me to Nischal Shetty and others at the exchange. The buying party were making big claims, their lack knowledge of the domain was telling a different story. Also, you tend to not believe such things at first, but the middle men seemed like credible people, unless they were being coned themselves. I wrote a consultants agreement with a clear markup fees to assist them in purchasing along with asking for their government issued proofs, it was shared with the concerned middle men, but the signed contracts or proofs were never delivered to me. I don’t push if someone has come through family. Thought it was still good to connect, and have an OTC account on the exchange for future transactions. This was my second trip to Mumbai in September after coming back from Russia, the first one in July didn’t yield much either.

I had Ash’s bangles remade once more to recoup some of the money lost because of his back tracking or just careless behaviour. It was still 22 carat gold. Overall, didn’t result in more than Rupees 20,000 recoupment. Then had them back to the previous values. Almost for nothing. He had a relative of one of his worker visiting from Gujarat to Delhi, going to London later that month. I delivered the bangles to this woman at the Indra Gandhi International Airport. Ash and Chico received them, there were no complaints.

3rd time’s a charm…maybe—>

Somewhere in btw, Anna joked about going to dating events. So, as part of the fun I threatened President Putin of Russia on Instagram to shut all the dating event till I was there 🤷🏽‍♂️. It was only for fun. There was no war at that time with Ukraine. 

I posted this photo from Dilwale Dulhaniya Lejayenge, and she posted a story of walking in sandals, and threatening to beat me with them. lol. 

![EB598013-ABB1-47FC-ACAB-5AA406C2D032.png](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%209d804b266a84446ba12aa4894239790d/EB598013-ABB1-47FC-ACAB-5AA406C2D032.png)

She posted the handpan, I checked the price to send it to her to keep her occupied till i get there, and it was seemingly INR 4000, i thought. Told Akash I would get it for her, he said to not waste money. Then he called me up after about 1 hour, and said to buy it. Aahhh. Then I checked the price to buy, and it was INR 40000! That’s total waste of money if you only have limited monies. lol. Had to disappoint her.

![2DC2BE26-7801-4ED2-98E5-80DF69AF897A.png](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%209d804b266a84446ba12aa4894239790d/2DC2BE26-7801-4ED2-98E5-80DF69AF897A.png)

While I was in Mumbai trying to deal with all this, Anna was going on a trek to the mountains. Better than over thinking. I had sent her another gift from True Treasures, one part of it was delivered, and I was supposed to collect the other myself from a delivery centre when visiting Tver. Again, these were extremely affordable. 

She made up a fake story about going to Almaty with idiotic Shakey. Totally did not fall for it, but still is that the person you have found to make me jealous?! lol.

![0E10572B-758F-4045-AE18-476427BBDDAD.png](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%209d804b266a84446ba12aa4894239790d/0E10572B-758F-4045-AE18-476427BBDDAD.png)

This all kept going on till I applied for visa as the ticket price was settling up, and was finally affordable. Akash was in constant touch throughout this. One of the occasions I met him on a Sunday, it was basically to tell him that I have seen insta stories of Charu, and I don’t like the tangent she’s on, being the one in touch with Anna. I didn’t want Charu to be under any confusion of me being interested—> I was not interested. Akash acted like he didn’t know about it. 

Charu blocked me immediately following that meeting with Akash, till then only i had blocked her, good she received the communication. What kind of thinking is that anyway? How can you love or be in a relationship with anyone knowing they love someone else?! Yet, you are trying to interfere? While talking about writing a journal, and “awareness.” Disregarded her as immature. Though, I didn’t like that sick mindset, more than anything else. 

Anna had posted something troublesome in the meanwhile, and I was missing her, cried at the restaurant. Akash was trying to console me. It was just out of the blue 🥹.

Not being able to raise money for Hex, still figuring out the inroads into tokenisation or other ways securing funding. I was trying to get a remote job in VFX—> asked Ashwin, but he didn’t have any ongoing projects. Emailed Mandeep Singh, he had offered me a job in 2014 during our conversations about VR, in that case, I had only got better by 2021. By the way, still not received any reply to my email to John Hughes.

Anyway, sent him a relatively to the point email, though instead of replying to the email, he posted a link on LinkedIn to the job application page of the company. Well, thats not how you treat a former co-workers. Didn’t appreciate it. I didn’t even request for any high office job, it was a kind of job to keep me going while being useful to them, could have worked out to the benefit of both. We could have had a conversation or he at least could’ve replied to the email. Results of more fake word of mouth?! But, whatever.

As evident, i had been concentrating on other things, didn’t have any recent VFX projects on my resume. Asked Ashwin If I could show work experience of his company on my resume, and he agreed without any hesitation. We had been working together since 2018, but on Hex. There was no short fall in my knowledge of VFX as the industry itself had not moved much, since I had deviated away. Applied to a couple of VFX jobs with that altered resume, though pretty quickly realised my mistake, and did not use that resume for anything other than those two jobs. I wanted to go propose to Anna with confidence, and made a desperate mistake. It also felt like I was showing too much confidence in Ashwin. So, even if i had got any of those jobs, I would had been at his peril, not an ideal or my kind of situation. Never do that, boys and girls.

These things were further pushing me towards the Blockchain Metaverse, as I could spot opportunities.

My new twitter/ X was active now.

For a moment, I fiddled with the idea of raising money for the space incubation venture, but it was not the right time.

Most of the Indian rocketry, at last till then was provided by Russia, and it felt like something I could help accelerate moving forward, if we were going to spend substantial time there because of the relationship. Even though the Soyuz was still being used by NASA, International Space Station flights, and others, this would have helped industries in both countries as Russia’s space program was stuck in the 1980’s, at best. There was no prior plan for this, before meeting Anna. Just was trying to make best use of what was going to be continuous physical presence at that location. Indian space sector was still emerging from the shadows. At the sametime, I had read about Elon’s forays into Russia when starting SpaceX, and was a little apprehensive.

Anyway, nothing much was happening to change the ground reality when it came to money. I had to take some monetary help from mom, for the first time in a long time to get the return ticket. It could have been offset with some money I had lend them, in the worse case scenario, but I was obviously planning on returning it as soon as possible. The idea was to settle the personal life, then maybe things start working out.

I had joked with Surbhi about making a documentary out of this romantic adventure, revenue stream any which way to make our life better! lol. Though, everyone is posting something silly on their social media, and earning money, so why not this?! Anyway.

So, I landed in Russia, and this time did not take hotel at Leningardsky station in Moscow, but took a train to Tver straight away, after having breakfast at that wonderful cafe at the station.

I reached Tver by the evening. Checked into Lemon Loft hotel, and could already notice some things which suggested less randomness. First thing, I had to do was to collect the ring I had ordered via True Treasures from a collection centre. I got to the collection centre, but it was not the right one or the timing was wrong. I went to another address nearby, but that was not even the collection centre. The language problem persisted. Yaroslav from True Treasures was in touch on the phone.

Had my usual flower girl in Tver deliver me flowers at the train station itself, so that I don’t waste anytime. She was pregnant, and had her boy friend drive her there. I was really thankful to her. Payment was already made online. It was really nice of her. “I hope whatever is going on between you and Anna, it works out.” She said.

Russian post was closed by that time or something as per this poster.

![IMG_0562.png](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%209d804b266a84446ba12aa4894239790d/IMG_0562.png)

![IMG_0561.png](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%209d804b266a84446ba12aa4894239790d/IMG_0561.png)

Things were complicated at that time, I was still blocked on WhatsApp. I don’t know, some strange stuff was posted. Didn’t care much. I wanted to take the present with me to her house, and decided to wait till the morning. 

The post office was open in the morning, though they told me that they did not receive this package and it should be available at a different collection centre. I had enough with this. Anna had posted a view of her house and a song on her insta stories that morning. There was a nice flower shop nearby the post office, I went in there, had a bouquet made, booked a Yandex taxi and on the way to her house.

I got to her house, asked the Taxi to wait nearby. This time I rang the door bell, but the door did not open. Anna’s neighbour, an old lady like in her 80’s or 90’s came outside with her dog, and looked at me funny. Special focus on the flowers. She did not speak any English, at all. 

Seeing me struggling with the door bell, Old Lady somehow communicated that the door bell is not working! Alright! The front lawn was all messed up as well, by the way. There was another door bell on the side, which she wanted to press, but still no one came out. She was enthusiastic, and determined to help, nonetheless.

Old lady asked me to knock the door. I knocked it lightly. She was not happy. She took it upon herself, and started banging with all her strength on the kitchen window while loudly shouting Anna’s name. I was a bit afraid. Like, she was really banging on that window. It seemed Anna came down the stairs as the old lady kept shouting, like asking her to open the door. But the door was not opened. 

Old Lady did not like this. I didn’t want to create a scene, and somehow communicated her to not worry. She looked really annoyed, and not happy with Anna. Well, we shared that sentiment. It was chilly, my hands were getting cold. I knocked one more time, called her name, asked her to open the door. Old lady kept looking at me, now on the street with her dog. It didn’t look like the door was going to open, so I got into the cab, and took off for the hotel. 

Called Akash on the way, I was not mad yet, just joking about the hilarity of the situation, and that she should have opened the door.

Got to the hotel. I thought it’s just a bit too much to still continue to do this, after I am here for the third time! Called Akash, and he suggested that I go there again. “I can’t keep doing this, it makes no sense”, told him. She should unblock me, we should meet somewhere to talk properly. He suggested that maybe there’s some miscommunication. I was a bit annoyed by that. “I am not going to beg her” I said. “You might have to do it” Akash said. That’s ridiculous, she’s still listening to other people when I am again going out of my way to make her comfortable. I knew the miscommunication was because of Shakey, and said something about him to Akash in anger. 

I was just walking around Tver for relaxation, and randomly sent this photo to Yaroslav. This is not an AI generated photo. So, if there’s a tornado in the background, I didn’t make the damn thing! It happened to be there behind the flower. I have no way of controlling the skies! But somehow the presence of this tornado was taken as a sign of my anger! What?! Realised, I was dealing with total whackos. What the fuck are you even talking about?! 

![IMG_8105.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%209d804b266a84446ba12aa4894239790d/IMG_8105.jpeg)

I was not blaming Akash for this, but he was in the middle, and it just didn’t make any sense. There’s no way I was going to beg anyone. Blocked Akash. Enough of all this, i thought. 

Someone had gone through my luggage the previous evening when I went to fetch the ring from the collection centre, so I had my own apprehensions about being unnecessarily put in suspicion. It did not feel safe. I arrange things a certain way, and get to know. 

Spread the word that I am going to Moscow. Left my dairy with a fake note behind. There was some kind of Sherlock Holmes thing ongoing, don’t know what they were looking for? So, I was giving them something to think about from the moment of arrival. I know my ground truth, but conspiracy theorists are always just looking for something to confirm their biases. 

I had put the flowers in the water, so not to buy a new bouquet. They are expensive if you keep buying them! 

This bouquet was just wonderful! The flower lady took extra time to make it. She chose the wrapper carefully as well. I was a bit bummed about the whole thing. Why can’t we just have a nice conversation, rather than whatever is going on?!

Fake flirted with the hotel owner while leaving for Moscow. Anna posted a story about some fish not being loyal, while she was being loyal. Okay?! Ash knew I had no one to meet in Moscow. Spent the whole time at Cinnabon Cafe at Leningardsky Station. It had replaced the candy shop from which I bought candy on the first trip. 

She gets cold feet when I show up, and starts making up things to hide her hesitation, out of insecurities. That was my partial assessment about the situation, at that time.

I came back to the hotel in Tver, and again my fake note had definitely been read. If you notice, it’s been written in readable hand writing compared to everything else that I don’t want anyone to read, only because of intellectual property reasons. If you were real Sherlock Holmes, then you would have noticed that for fuck sake. But like I said, total whackos.

The visa was again only for 14 days, and days were running out. Return ticket to India was already booked for 8th Oct. Am I here for all this rubbish?, I thought. Maybe, let’s make it a holiday! I had not seen any Russia or Moscow even though this was my third trip to this country. So, I decided to check out from Tver, and go back to Moscow. There was no point in spending time in Tver among all this confusion. Like I stated previously, people do stupid things all the time, and call them mistakes. This was happening a third time! Crazy.

Anna posted weird stuff between me leaving the hotel, and getting to the Tver train station. A Beatle on her arm, she’s blowing it away or something. Another, she’s swinging on the sea saw with special focus on her shoes. There was a narrative of Shakey buying shoes for her, and I was supposed to be jealous. I was appalled, but not at all jealous. 

![IMG_0565.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%209d804b266a84446ba12aa4894239790d/IMG_0565.jpeg)

Texted Sanjay Suri. He was running in some park in Versova. Told him that there are people wanting me to beg for love and relationship, and that’s not being myself. I hadn’t done anything wrong. He seconded that thought. Just wanted to talk to someone outside the loop, but the reason I really contacted him was to restart the conversation, and get the INR 200,000 that he owed me, even partial payment would have made life easier at that time.

First evening back in Moscow I spent most of the day at the Leningardsky Station itself, at my favourite cafe. The food there was not your usual fast food, but healthy stuff. The staff there had come to know me as I had been visiting them every few months now, maybe someone had been checking on me as well. 

One of the reasons I liked being situated properly in cafe’s with electricity + Wi-Fi was because of the construction job. I was trying not to get into any arguments with Ash, therefore, the whole year I  just did as he asked even if it was not exactly right, and apologised if required, to keep peace. It was important to save energy while continuing the revenue stream.

I did check out the hotel at the station itself, where I had stayed before, but they only had expensive rooms available.

One of the waitress at this cafe, thought I was hitting at her when asked if she knows any affordable, but good hotels around? She was the one who usually served me, spoke some English. I always have had this problem, my normal questions are constituted as flirting or asking out—> could see it on her face. Booked a hotel nearby, and left.

This was a cozy hotel, but slightly expensive for my budget. Had breakfast, then moved back to Leningardsky station in the afternoon. Spent rest of the day there itself, as it was not easy to move around with the luggage. Finally, I had to book a hotel in the night, and this new hotel was based on the top floor of a polytechnic, liberal arts and fashion school 👇

This hotel was based in an area with a local vibe. I walked from the station to this place, about 5km. It was accessible through the school. Really old infrastructure. The washroom reminded me of the Indian washrooms from the 90’s, and maybe they did get inspiration from Russia? This room had 4 single beds, i only used 1, obviously. The attendant was interesting—> I joked with her about being sloppy while checking in, and she said “I don’t mind.” Okay?! She had her own full room behind the counter. I don’t know. Saw some weird people there during the brief stay. I didn’t want to get in trouble, and went to my room.

Sent some of these photo to Sanjay, and posted them on twitter to say I was staying there with someone on invitation, but I was staying alone. [Bookings.com](http://Bookings.com) receipt is available. Sanjay looked at the photo above and asked “if thats her?” and i said “she wishes” lol. That’s how you direct a movie, bud.

Translated version of Anna’s insta story.

![679445C1-51DB-46AD-BFB4-7A5F0C6E3D63.png](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%209d804b266a84446ba12aa4894239790d/679445C1-51DB-46AD-BFB4-7A5F0C6E3D63.png)

Messaged Natalie, said she was in St Petersburg. Did think about going there for a second, but nah. For some reason, I can’t move a muscle or travel to far away places for anyone else other than for Anna. It’s a whole other problem that she does not appreciates it at all. lol.

Next day, i moved to Sunflower Hotel 🌻 as it was available at an affordable rate for a day, and seemed like a better place compared to the soviet era hotel. This place was kinda around a happening spot with shopping malls, and other shops. There was a religious monument around which looked like a hybrid of the church and a mosque. I asked Natalie if she knew about it, but she didn’t know either. There was also a Raddisson Blu round the corner, but i had no budget to explore that.

Spent the day wandering around, and went to a nearby buffet in the evening based on recommendation from google maps. I was fine till then. Gaurav from Urbanpod had called me before on WhatsApp, and had a chat.

Picked the food, and a drink, sat down near the window seat, but as soon as I sat to eat, kept thinking about Anna. Like, she was right there with me. She had posted something during the last couple of days based on my fake stories about having a fling with a university student in response to her own fake stories—> I was trying not to care about, but it still bothered me. Just started crying there itself, could not stop the flood gates. Couldn’t even finish the food. Came back to the hotel. 

![IMG_8211.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%209d804b266a84446ba12aa4894239790d/IMG_8211.jpeg)

I knew Gaurav was in the urbanpod group or whatever, he had been to Goa with idiot Shakey. But just could not control crying even when I called him. There was still time, i was just trying to explain the whole situation to him, if in case he could help. That’s the most I have cried ever. Even with Akash at the restaurant, I did not cry that much, and I never cried in my life before that. It just happened.

That same night, she posted photos of being on a local trip with some family, wearing shades, she had been crying as well. But she posted this being arrogant, like “i told you won’t be able to do without me.” Yes, I can’t, but common. Unblock or call me. We were only struggling with external acceptance of egos, internally there is an undeniable connection. We are from different countries, different cultures and lived strange lives. We both have a mind of our own, and like freedom of being, complications can happen. It lack of maturity + over thinking on Anna’s part really, and lack of financial security on mine to dive head first into the relationship. We needed to have a conversation—> so, she would not blame me later, for not telling her about “being a completely empty handed person.” But like mentioned before, Anna over relied on third person feedback based on childhood traumas. 

I was running out of money, and it was only starting of the month as well. I had been paid like not a week back. Anyway, i finally found the urbanpod of Moscow! Or its closest equivalent. 

 

[Kraski Leta, Moscow, Russia](https://www.booking.com/hotel/ru/kraski-leta.en-gb.html)

Instead of pods, they had rectangular rooms, and common washrooms in the basement. I am not really a backpacking tourist, though looked like one to fit right into this place. Pretty sure, I would have owned it like Urban pod if stayed here, as long as I stayed there. But, it was only for couple of days. 

I don’t like being a tourist, and visiting tourist spots. Just staying in different hotels, and exploring general culture, people, life is interesting enough. Did not fire up Tinder this time around. I was really heart broken.

This hotel was close to the station being within 2km radius, and yet the city was really accessible from this location.

Asked Alexey if he wants to meet, but he made more excuses. Fine. Whatever, I thought. I was feeling really alone.

[https://x.com/pathintegral0/status/1445805710214774786](https://x.com/pathintegral0/status/1445805710214774786)

Finally, Alexey sent me a message asking to come to his place. It was right around the corner from the hotel. Really close to the station as well. I thought, what was stopping him till his time?! Anyway, we met. It always good to see old connections, even if snobby. Met few of his friends. He told me about the current situation. He was working on some music video, and offered that I come along to the shoot, buy obviously I had a flight to catch next day. 

He ordered food, and I paid for it. Good. He seemed really cagey, and yet being snobby. The meal was little over my budget, at that time. It seemed like he owned that whole building, think thats what he said. It was a bank before. Showed me his spiritual products, i bought couple of incandescent stick packs. Thought I would post one of the incandescent sticks to Anna from the airport, she liked this stuff, and the other one was for parents. 

I wanted to be even with him. No baggage. Didn’t like the way he kept telling me about Indian temples having a lot of money, while still asking for help from foreigners. Not discussing, but telling, along with a story about someone coning him. You are a member of ISKCON, should you indulge with people, thats your choice. Why is this conversation directed at me?! Anyway, it felt like we were definitely even. I did not have much money left after this, other than to get to the Airport. Not even for dinner. It still felt nice on the way back to the hotel. 

![8CFCFADC-40DA-4435-9B91-A3AB2B0BEE4B.png](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%209d804b266a84446ba12aa4894239790d/8CFCFADC-40DA-4435-9B91-A3AB2B0BEE4B.png)

Gaurav told me to go to Tver after our conversation, but I wanted Anna to call me to not repeat the same thing. Then he said it was too late, based on my return flight. I was only asking for his, Akash’s, Sanjay’s, Frank’s or anyone else’s advice to know how much they already knew, and not to factor in their actual opinion into my decisions.

If you drink 2 beers and 1 old fashioned once in 2 months, that does not makes you a drunk. Once in a while, I would drink with Vineet Walimbe during the day, because we met in the day. We met total of 3 times in 2 years, and did not drink on the first meeting in Powai. I would drink once in a while with Khushbu, and Gaurav. In comparison, Gaurav used to keep a bottle of Whisky in the pods, nothing wrong with it, but i never did that sort of thing. Sometimes, i used to order 1 beer or lemonade, when Gaurav would order 4 drinks. Like explained in the earlier essays, thats the definition of occasional social drinking. For the record. Always paid for myself, so it’s all provable via bank payments as well. Didn’t used to keep much cash.

Spent the night wandering around the town, and took some more photos. I was still waiting for Anna’s call, but she didn’t call. She posted this insta story instead, blaming me, when I had a flight to catch, next day. How can it have no addresse when you are referring to the stone? Common. Deceiving herself, pretty much.

Shake what off?—>

Surbhi was telling to “Shake it off.” First of all, i would be a wanker if I was shaking it every day, but i used to wank it off like once a week/ some times in 2 weeks to manage fuckin hormones. Only time, i went a little over board on wanking was upon returning back 4th time from Russia, feeling completely untethered to Anna, but still managed to keep control, and bring balance to the force.

Sexual health affects everything including your skin, mood and stamina. So, not to act out of sexual frustration like rest of the human populace who are horny all the time. Don’t tell me porn or soft porn or fashion exists because of some higher or divine purpose you fuckin horny wankers. Pretty sure ‘heads of states’ shake it off from time to time like scientists or artists do to stay sane. Unless you are a wealthy individual able to keep multiple sexual interests or whatever in case of being into that sort of thing, while remaining humanistic 🤷🏽‍♂️.

I can count on one hand, the number of times I have seen porn—> so, less than 15 times, and that too out of curiosity mostly after Sunny Leone made entry into Bollywood. I am not subscribed to any platform apps that host soft porn web series. Only platforms I ever had subscription for a limited period were Netflix and Apple TV to catch up on acclaimed series or films. 

Never used onlyfans or any other such apps. I am not judging those who do watch legal porn or soft porn or use interactive apps! What I do or don’t is not a barometer to judge others.

Never sent any low vibe messages or invitations to anyone on Instagram or any other social media websites.

For two years, I use to live in the same house with 4 young + wonderful women in London, and was never inappropriate with them. I lived in a hotel for more than 2 years, and was never inappropriate with anyone there either. What else?

It’s difficult for single men, and woman to get laid or date regularly. Sexual health is related to mental health, as well. It’s a reality—> you can either suppress your sexual urges, and take them out in other ways like anger, pride, random aggression/ chutzpah or have—> legal + consensual sex if possible or wank the wily once in a while. Balance is important, like everything else.

Anything is better than doing extremely criminal shady stuff like flying with Epstein or any such inhumane or illegal activities. 

Also, you can’t “shake off” love. Fucking narratives to look good. At least, don’t also be a hypocrite. This is not for Surbhi, but anyone making this fake argument—> STFU. 🙏🏽

# So, where were we?!

I had been posting Samurai gifs in defence to the ghost gangs shenanigans. Now, Anna had got into martial arts apparently. She was posting weird things, it was kinda too late when all we had to do was meet when I was there. But I love her, and was responding.

Anna posted about writing journal in a team. So, this was my attemp to get on her team.

Dry Ink—>

I had gotten in touch with Sid Jain on one of the trips to Mumbai earlier. Trying to rekindle the working relationship past his and Manisha’s hotstar scandal by temporarily giving him the Microsoft Hololens as he had once asked to buy one for himself. I also sent him my projects to find a suitor. Looking to get paid any which way. 

However, the ghost gang had got upto him as well by this time, and he had not actually pitched it to anyone till then. Like why?! Other than taking inspiration. Why would I ask you for help, and you are not taking it seriously? How many years do we know each other now? 2009. So it’s been 12 years. Sure, i didn’t approach him for Metagame, but common, have you heard about getting over things? He tells me “get the macro sorted by getting a co writer, it’s like dating.” Yeah, for sure. I keep an eye on everyone. One leaf from here to there, and things are pretty much apparent. 

“Get the Marco right, then things can work out.” Sid.

“Will you help me get the Marco right” I replied

It was a No. Proceeded by the co writer conversation. 

I asked if he could make any recommendations or connect me with someone? 

Not really.

There are very few executives or producers who actually read scripts. He was not wrong about the Marco, also known as “the packaging” but what do you think being part of Ashwin company was about? Or why am I contacting you? Who else will help with the Marco if you can’t? I didn’t used the word Marco, but why else would I contact him? He’s not a writer, can’t help with “Cowriting.” 

I heard this so many times—> “We like it but the audience won’t like it?” I am sorry, so how do you evaluate something? It’s a guess? Packaging is not some science or logic based routine, it’s about having connections, and liquidity. Anyway. 

Everyone wants to get as far as they can without paying in Bollywood. Like, what are you even in the business of exactly? Collecting toys? I like comics, and toys, but not at all a materialist collector or a show off. That’s fine then. My track record is right here. All the stuff written is tangible. What is your track record, by the way? I am not trying to disrespect, but let’s open this thing up right? You don’t like my comments about your content? Lol.

One flew over the cuckoo’s nest—>

I used to frequent at the Tata Starbucks in Khan Market. As stated, it is walking distance from the metro station on a straight metro line from Faridabad, the settings were nice with plenty of natural light. It used to be open early morning, till late in the night. Also, you could move to Connaught Place anytime being only couple of stations away.

The ghost gang had got to my physical location, and trying to heal me to madness like them, being the only sane person left on planet earth like ‘I am Legend’ among zombies. lol. They were led by ‘The Holistic Psychologist.’ I don’t blame the psychologist, but you gotta realise that without universal awareness, you are pretty much as good as the data, and if the data supplied is fake then your endeavour of healing me are actually an attempt to make me sick instead. It’s like forcibly putting a sane person in the asylum, and electrocuting him when he pleads his sanity. 

They basically declared me schizophrenic because I was frequently moving the long chair with a flat bottom at the cafe bar counter, because of the pain in my hips and back. lol. “You are angry” well, yes, because you are idiots. Filled with bias, and prejudice about everything.

It’s not like I am naturally angry and hitting people on the street, i don’t have a violent record or anything. My frustration is directly related to your stupid and ridiculous actions. At one point, they are telling me to get a job. I already had a job! That’s how much you know me, because you are not listening to me at all. Also, as evident from this essay, i had been trying to extend + add to my revenue streams already. It’s just judgemental idioticness of people like Charu and Shakey. 

Anna unblocked me on WhatsApp, and sent a long message which was pretty much false narrative of the events. She knew it. I replied to her with facts. She replied with these—>

The holistic psychologist is big on cold baths/ therapy. Sure, it could be helpful combined with other nourishing activities, in controlled conditions and routine. But not just randomly blowing air directly on my face at full blast from the air conditioner at Starbucks. I don’t have high tolerance for dirty air from an industrial air conditioner being blown at my face, and fell sick. It’s something related to the sinus infection, apparently.

There was a teenager or early 20’s named MAX, who was there every time I would visit the cafe. I did not meet him outside of that cafe, and or just randomly bumping at some corner of Khan Market. Anyway, he was extremely interested in my life. I didn’t used to take him seriously, he’s a kid. Everything about him was immature, and foolish. Sure, he might have had good intentions, but just having good intentions is not always helpful.

There was this unsaid pressure to visit Tver again to compete the love story. But, I didn’t really want to without a proper conversation with Anna, and didn’t have the money. Sure, the job was still ongoing, but it was only a matter of time based on Ash’s health, maybe a year more, I thought. I was still trying to find some way to make a dent, but it was also end of the year, people are already in festive mode.

The holistic psychologist was posting all kinds of Instagram posts based on feedback from people associated in my life, particularly some cousins, and sister in law—> i knew because of knowing them, and their thinking. They are not kind people, either.

It was not the correct feedback, these people are were in the quick sand of their own biases to judge anyone else. So, in a way the holistic psychologist was giving me data to relate people who had become part of this thing. I used to confirm their involvement by telling or showing something specific to them, and seeing that piece of information in one of the posts or through another contact in the gang. It’s all relative.

![I never smoked, and don’t recommend.](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%209d804b266a84446ba12aa4894239790d/IMG_3785.jpeg)

I never smoked, and don’t recommend.

Just when my fever got fixed, a freak accident happened outside the house which damaged the cornea of my left eye. I tried washing the eye whole day, but in the evening my vision filled with a white filter, and not even clear. It was horrific. I called dad who was at the temple. We went to an eyes hospital first, but it was closed. Then to a nearby hospital, but they only had emergency ward working, it being a Sunday. They told us to keep washing the eyes, well it did not seem helpful. We went to the chemist shop in front of this hospital to get some regular eye drops, there a stranger also at the shop told us about an eye specialist in sector 16 who had a clinic at home, and might to able to help. He had his mother treated by this doctor, also gave us the phone number—> thank you to this person, wherever you are!

[https://x.com/pathintegral0/status/1460319880591273986](https://x.com/pathintegral0/status/1460319880591273986)

We went straight to his home, and called him from his front gate. At first, he was a little reluctant as it was past 6.30pm, but then agreed, and called us inside.

There was no one at the clinic, he opened it only for us! I told him as above. He checked the eye, and said “you came at the right time, a little late, and might have lost the eye.” Well, alright. Dad was giving his usual long winded complicated description, which had nothing to do with the problem. We chit chatted a little—> “I make movies, how will i make movies without one eye?!” I told him. “You are worried about making movies?” lol.

He also gave me the eye drops from his in-house pharmaceutical shop. This doctor was wonderful. 

But the problem was that I could still could not see from this eyes, and there was irritation till the morning. I thought of getting a second opinion from an old time eye doctor, but his daughter was at the clinic. She checked the eyes, and said that it’s permanently damaged, and would need to be operated on, but very few people actually do this operation in India. Okay?! She also put some droplets in the eyes. 

I thought, it was best to go back to the wonderful eye doctor from last night. It’s about experience when it comes to medical science, he seemed to have dealt with these issues before in his practice.

He figured that I had been to another doctor, and told me not to worry. It will take time, but it will be alright. Had to keep the eye covered up, bought cheap sunglasses. It was to protect the amount of light going into the eye. Thanks to doctor, dad, and the stranger, the eye was saved. It took time, but got better.

The ghost gang thought i was making an excuse to not visit Tver. Well, like i said, these people were in the quick sand of their own biases.

But then Anna posted a series of stories about being in someone’s car, and travelling to a winter lodge alongside a lake. I knew what it was, and responded with a date of travel. Had applied for a 30 days Visa in btw all this, and had received it. The tickets were still expensive. Why can’t we just have a conversation to figure things out?! I thought.

I also wanted to warn Anna about the people she was taking feedback from, and like I said about “being completely empty handed.” Only in monetary terms, other than the construction job. I had all these projects, of course. It was only about being at it, for one of them to have worked out, especially with personal life in place. 

![IMG_3863.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%209d804b266a84446ba12aa4894239790d/IMG_3863.jpeg)

The argument about “dealing with uncertainty” does not exactly applied here, because only I stood to be in financial problems, if again she had got cold feet or something else. This is a situation where we could have spoken about after al this time. Didn’t particularly liked this way, to be honest.

There was a ticket available, but it was still expensive. I had the visa, but did not book the ticket. Wait and watch. She apparently had been doing some preparations. 

Had even bought winter clothing, and some extras for temperature as low of -30 Celsius. I was a bit scared of going to that temperature, but fear is not always a bad thing, as i prepared well.

I had already used most of my credit limits this year, and was in fact, paying them back. By the time, the day of travel came, the tickets were already expensive. I knew with the current savings, it was impossible to travel. Honestly, i did not care, it was a genuine problem, and she was the one being childish. Didn’t appreciate all the ghosting. I had mum in the loop about everything re finances, and the situation.

Even if I had purchased the ticket to Tver, i was not in a position to purchase the return ticket. Got to the airport. Spent some time there. Called Ash to see if he could help with some advance or something, rather than directly asking for money. When he did not get the point, i did ask directly as well. But, no. I was at the Oxford book shop in Worldmark 1, Aerocity. There was someone there keeping an eye on me, for whatever reason.

Even spoke to Akash, tried to vaguely explain the situation. Spoke to mom, and took loan from her of the short fall to purchase the ticket. Arranged a dummy ticket for the return flight to get through immigration. I would have got paid by the end of the month or i could have asked Ash for an advance mid way to buy the return ticket. All this, based on the hope that I would be staying with Anna, rather than spending money on hotels. In that case, I could have bought the return ticket earlier as well. 

Then, I got the most affordable ticket for 4 days later. Anna was already upset, as I said earlier, she was expecting me that day itself, and had been preparing something. I called her, after returning home, but she did not reply. Also, i did shut the door of my room with a bang to throw off the ghost gang agent sister in law. It was not in anger, but deliberate. I don’t bang doors, generally. 

The holistic psychologist was onto everything I did, as my trauma based on false feedback of ghost gang agents. There was even a recommendation of sleeping with each other, but with clothes on?! Who asked you about that? That’s just not cool. Ash gave me some extra work, so I had bit of cash at hand. Also, i had some short projects planned to do during this time for some mor extra revenue.
