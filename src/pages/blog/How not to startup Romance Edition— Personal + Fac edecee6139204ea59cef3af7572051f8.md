What shall I tell you about love? It’s the only emotion that truly matters in the whole wide world. When love calls you gotta give it your all. It’s not the time to take advice from stock market experts or any other “experts.” 

![IMG_1033.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20edecee6139204ea59cef3af7572051f8/IMG_1033.jpeg)

 

Action is the best advice for an astronaut.

Landed in Mumbai, India at the Chatarpati Shivangi International Airport in Mumbai, and I had a connecting flight to Delhi. There was some strange procedure where I was stamped based on the negative Covid test report I had from London. I had to pay for the adjoining lounge for a quick release from the que. But the stamp got erased while washing my hands. I went back to the officials, and they stamped it again. 

Anyway, I landed back in Delhi. Had to self isolate for 3 days, though didn’t want to hunker down at home because of all the negativity. Also, the sudden change of environment was still sinking in. 

At first, booked the Ginger Hotel in Faridabad for one night. Took an Uber as usual from the Airport, but there was some problem with the internet so it was a cash payment. The bank cards were not working, we tried at couple of ATM’s. Then finally I was able to withdraw cash from a third ATM near the railway station. Cab dropped me at the hotel, but I forgot to pick up one of my two bags from the cab as it drove away. It had been 24 hours of travelling. Not too worried as it only had clothes. Phone’s battery was also low. Called the cab driver while plugged into the hotel reception. Driver came back with the bag, and gave him some more money for the help.

Mom and dad visited, but stayed downstairs only. We kept social distancing. Looking at the hotel room, I was still not out of the apocalypse. lol. It was like the hotel was not kept up at all. It was difficult to even use the duvet. 

I changed hotels next morning to Park Plaza in sector 21. This was much better with clean interiors, and a garden view. Kept doing the usual work during this time. Took a Covid test after 3 days. It came back negative. All good.

This was taken a few days after.

I had not messaged Anna, because she had not messaged me either, and did not wish new year. She gotta stop being so cagey about everything. At the same time, I was talking to Chikee, and it seemed like messages were being shared across. She was posting stories with the astronaut locket, and expecting my presence.

Covid restrictions were still in place generally speaking. Flight to Russia had still not resumed. I spent most of the January in Delhi. It was still a weird feeling. 

We were still trying to package Hex. Had been in touch with Jan Nathanson of Canada who I had met at Film Bazaar in 2013 to come aboard or help with development finance since before leaving for London. She had given some feedback about the script, and incorporated the valid one into the new draft. 

We again had a VC in Jan end, and she said “so you have actually written the script!” Hmm why would you think otherwise when we got in touch re the project, and I sent you the script? Weird. Jake’s been in touch with you as well?! She also suggested that Ashwin should direct it because he was more “Popular.” Okay, now you are making so sense at all. It’s fine. She had not made an animated film before, and was only trying to help. Maybe, be more explicit about why are you being so strange?!

I used to turn off my camera during VC’s either immediately or after initial intros to save data or to have clear communication without overloading the feed.

Nothing major came out of that other than she was supposed to get back to us with something in terms of the development funding. 

Surprise surprise—>

Anna blocked me on Instagram one week before Valentine’s Day, when I tried getting in touch. But also posted the longest self indulgent series of insta stories looking at herself as a victim of her own actions. Being self indulgent is nothing bad, we all do it. The stories were almost a call for someone to ask her out for valentines day. Did she needed to block me? No.

I ordered flowers for her, but didn’t put my name on it. Who else will send her flowers? What ex’s? That’s exactly what I thought at that time. She was just being silly. She could have spoken about all that directly with me, opened up rather than only posting stories, and we would be in a better place. That’s easier said than done, and was the subject of the posts. She was finding it difficult opening up to new relationships. But why block me?! How did that solve anything? I thought she didn’t even have marbles left in her head anymore. Of course, it not nice being blocked again and again for no apparent reasons after all this.

![IMG_0484.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20edecee6139204ea59cef3af7572051f8/IMG_0484.jpeg)

The delivery guy was supposed to send me a photo of the flowers upon delivery. So, i knew right away that she got the flowers from service. But, Anna herself also posted about receiving the flowers, being all surprised that someone sent her flowers on Valentine’s Day! She was more happy than I had expected. That’s awesome. I was going to let her enjoy the moment.

![That’s her insta story inquiring about the “secret admirer”](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20edecee6139204ea59cef3af7572051f8/IMG_2261.jpeg)

That’s her insta story inquiring about the “secret admirer”

She made a bunch of guesses in her stories. Maybe, she thinking why would i send her anything after being blocked? Maybe, check with me? Who else will send you flowers on Valentine’s day?!

![That’s another one of her posts.](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20edecee6139204ea59cef3af7572051f8/IMG_2267.png)

That’s another one of her posts.

It was all worth it when I saw the smile and joy on her face. Still, I was not going to help with the uncertainty unless she texted herself.

When it seemed someone else might take the credit for my flowers, I told Chikee. So, that he could spread the word. 

Flights to Russia were opened late Feb. Indian passport holders were only allowed to travel on direct and non connecting flights.

Detour—>

I met Surbhi Dewan at Turtle Cafe, Khan Market to catch up, and to discuss projects. It had been a longtime. She had been to Russia to visit a friend who’s an animator, and told me to definitely try the river cruise in Moscow. Well. We spoke about various things including a film I had been developing about women and girls, but different. I had conceived this idea, and had been researching but didn’t want to direct it or maybe, co direct. You gotta put the seeds in, and they grow like wild flowers. Surbhi had always came across as not being confident, but she had talent.

![IMG_4903.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20edecee6139204ea59cef3af7572051f8/IMG_4903.jpeg)

We also spoke about making a movie out of the last year of my life. Like, this movie titled “Searching” but different with more emotions.

The Fictional City of Bombay—>

I had been staying at the pods again. Chikee was there, but thats pretty much it other than few new people. Gaurav was stuck in Mumbai during the pandemic, and had stayed with the annoying guy from Chhattisgarh in some serviced apartments. Now he was apparently in Chandigarh, preparing to leave anytime for New York. 

Frank was not back. I was not in touch with Mr. Ramani or anyone else. Did not meet Khushbu after JWT. 

Detour—>

There was someone new trying to buy, and sell gloves or masks. I was suppose to meet them, hold fort till Lalit, an associate of Mr. Murthy could come to make the deal. He was 2 hours late because of traffic. There was no deal. It was another 4 hours wasted. The congregation met again in Delhi to deal the deal. It was another chapter of Priyadarshan’s movie. lol. Everyone waiting around a tea stall was apparently selling masks and gloves. Like, if you approach a random person standing on the foot path, they were the middle man. Each of them a unique character as well. Hilarious. Everyone was waiting for some Gagan Goyal. “Who’s writing this script?” I thought. 

After about two hours Gagan Goyal arrived, and said he doesn’t have the keys to the place where the consignment is stored to display a sample. I bought tea for all of them at McDonald's, about 15 people. You can’t make this shit up. 

The Fictional City of Bombay—>

We were finding no traction for the projects. There was some negative chatter in the industry? Who was spreading it? Met Ashwin at Kitchen Garden in Juhu where he suggested looking for institutional finance for his company by contacting investment managers via LinkedIn. Also, he wanted me to do that. I did that 10 years ago, it does not work. Like already explained, his company was an agency, there was no upside for anyone to invest. 

I floated various ideas about NFT’s and Tokenisation to build HEX. We can’t disrupt with a project like this while only trying conventional ways, but he was acting like a total naysayer. I could have dived into it with some monetary breathing space, and not having to do the construction job. I was trying anything, and everything to start an additional revenue stream to not be totally dependent on Ash’s job. There was constant work with another hotel project, but there was no future in that realm. Also, Ash’s health was still bad, Amy was taking care of things on ground with the usual friction. 

Had been looking to Pivot, though still stuck with the idea of making Hex, as it was a wonderful script with a lot of potential. It being a tech based creative endeavour rather than being a tech enterprise, we just needed the right strategy with the right investment. I sent the project deck to the Indian Angle Network. Ashwin was surprised, well. You gotta try, just acting like a “know it all” with negative bias does not move the needle. 

Ashwin had some political connections with the BJP, and wanted to base the production in Mauritius because of the tax credit. I had no information about the actual proposed arrangement or technical information other than his word for it. I was more interested having a co production between India and Uk, taking advantage of the UK production tax credit while making a great animated movie. 

It was one thing to call be stubborn for pushing to make the movie, and another to not being able to produce the dam thing for a dime on his fucking belly. Animated movies are a more collaborative endeavour when compared with live action movies, I even proposed getting directors on board, but it was strategically decided to first get the visual development done. It’s easy to call someone “stubborn” when I was only holding onto the vision, but you, yourself are unable to hear ‘NO’ for your stupid opinions. How would I write about 14 drafts if I was “stubborn?” The improved drafts were based on feedback. It’s an age old of technique to spread false information about someone’s character to have control over them or to gain power, right out of Jake’s playbook. “Difficult to work with”, my ass. I like getting done if they are actually actionably getting done. Put the money on the table if you are serious, otherwise it’s coffee table convo—> a wild ride, and you are welcome to the fun.

IAN replied back after assessment, and decline to take it further due to the uncertainty of the domain, and markets at that time. It was a long shot, anyway. Venture capital and Film finance don’t usually go hand in hand.

Just running a conventional business even via a terrific app was not going to cut it for myself. You gotta now yourself, and i knew that it either had to be a high stakes creative endeavour or hardcore tech or Space for my senses to concentrate. 

It did not feel like a failure as I was constantly delivering quality scripts for the kind of movies I wanted to make in an industry stuck in its own image, and not wanting to take chances. I always knew that it would be difficult, just didn’t factor in the character assassination and manipulation because of enviousness.

It felt like getting my personal life in order would be really helpful. I was in love with Anna, it was not even a question of exploring other options. But I needed her totally in my corner, not being insecure, not being in any doubt that we belong together. We were both base din different countries, that was the reality, and it was going to take money to make the relationship work in the long term without it feeling like a burden to either. There was also issues of insecure families. Money is not everything, but at the same time it does solves many issues. That was the only issue in my head, that’s what I needed help with or one of the projects to work out. I know where I stand at all times. Philosophy of action is most useful. Practicality.

No matter what, I was not going to lose Anna. We can earn money while standing with each other. 

It’s early 2021. Everything was anyway still in hibernation mode due to Covid 19. I decided to make the move in early march. 

This phase of the series will play out in 4 acts. 

![IMG_1703.png](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20edecee6139204ea59cef3af7572051f8/IMG_1703.png)

Act 1—>

I had quite a bit of research about Russia, and it seemed like with similar currency values, only 7 hour flight, we could make this work for a year or so, and something or other projects would definitely workout in the meantime.

I had also been speaking to Ash about talking to Steve of Blackmore Hotel about a remote job similar to his. I didn’t want to bypass Ash as a matter of loyalty. Rather than alternate revenue streams, maybe I could generate revenue stream in the same domain? An additional client like Steve paying more than Ash would had been enough breathing space till Hex or another project would have started. There was still time left on my Visa till June end. 

Spoke to Ash about spending a month or so in London after getting engaged with Anna to fix this arrangement, make up for the money I had lost, and we could then apply for a proper work visa. He agreed. I had confirmed with him. Before I was supposed to leave, Ash asked me have gold bangles made for Chico. At first, I inquired with a jeweller in GK1 he had bought something from when he was in India for his case hearing. But it was all too expensive, and was not going to be delivered in time. 

My Mum recommended jeweller of my sister in law. Well, she’s not exactly “easy going” so I was a bit apprehensive, but it seemed like the best option at the time. They said that there is no exact 24 carrot, think it was made in 22 carrot or as close as possible. Ash was consulted for the design. There was some back n forth. I was making Rupees 20 grand on top for getting it all done. Still short 70K from loss in January. Anyway, it was done, and I had them securely with me. So, there was no question I was travelling to London for the job, and he knew. For the record.

I had tentative plans of travelling to Russia on my birthday on 15th March 2021—> had told that to Chikee. That plan did not materialise. Russian visa centre had moved from VFS to an office in Tolstoy Building on Kasturba Gandhi Mary at Janpath. But also, on the exact day I was supposed to apply for the Visa, the visa fees increased x4. The flights also got really expensive because of Corona virus. Just weird coincidences keep happening all the time! 

I texted Anna on my birthday from Tata Starbucks in Khan Market, it’s close to the metro and an airy space. That’s where I used to hunker down most mornings. She was expecting me there in Russia, and asked “what are you doing here, Rohit?” That gave it away, I was not there. She was playful, but didn’t know the exact line with being blocked so many times last year, and didn’t want to get blocked when I am making big moves to meet her in person. She sent the longest voice message yet, but did not wish “happy birthday 🥳” ☹️. I kept listening to her beautiful voice, replaying the message like a song 🥹. 

At the same time, I had to create some melodrama to not let the moment slip away. Kept listening to O’sanam from Lucky Ali, and sent an affordable jewellery from True Treasures to keep Anna occupied 😁.

From my usual hangout at Epicurus mall, in Nehru Place. 

That’s when I again involved Akash and Charu as additional characters to pass on information, but thinking they are extracting information. Akash had called me on his own after I had applied for Visa, and I knew from that conversation that he was in the know. Is the whole world in the know? I thought.

I wrote my first sci-fi essay kinda thing about our love, put it on medium, and sent It to all the middle man. She liked that type of writing, and posted a photo of herself suspended in a morning sun beam next day.

Lo’pera cafe, Epicuria Mall

You need cash at hand when visiting someplace unknown without any support. The tickets from Delhi—> Moscow—> London were expensive. I would have been severely strapped for cash if payed from pocket. Suddenly, the limit on my Bajaj EMI card expanded because of my good track record, and I put the whole thing on it. Had a regular income, it didn’t seem like a problem.

Anyway, I applied for a 14 days visa as other than being cheaper, it was processed with minimal documents.  Got the Visa without any problems. There was some argument about timings during collection, but that’s usual stuff in India.

Anna used to repost stories of a Ukrainian jewellery designer based in Kiev named Alona. She used to make wonderful jewellery, especially rings. I got in touch with her about a ring for Anna. 

![IMG_0732.png](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20edecee6139204ea59cef3af7572051f8/IMG_0732.png)

Alona asked for her finger size. I didn’t have her finger size, but also I didn’t want to ask Anna to keep the act. I knew, she knows, but she was not replying to my messages. It felt like she’s demanding “be here now.” We figured out all the details—> i was supposed to send the size to the designer upon reaching Tver, and she was going to courier the package directly there from Kiev. No money was exchanged, yet. She was nice.

Covid was having a resurgence with cases spiking up, though still not as bad as before. I got a negative test report, and was on a flight to Russia. 

Anyone I had spoke to before going on this trip had warned me about Russia being harsh place including Frank—>  “Be careful buddy, it’s rough out there.” Frank had never been to Russia. At the Airport, i came to know that no one exchanges INR to Russian Rouble, but United States Dollars were the recommended currency if you were going as a tourist. So, I got some U$D. Later, I learned it was not required as my Wise Traveller’s card worked seamlessly with real-time conversion from GBP to Rouble, and it was connected to my Apple Pay which was also accepted everywhere in Russia.

I had visited ‘Cart Lane’ in Southex, and Lajpat Nagar before embarking on this journey, but the diamond on those rings were not as big as the ring from Kiev. At the departure terminal I thought Anna will get really mad if I had no ring at all! Spotted a Swarovski outlet, and thought I should carry an interim Ring till we get her finger size for the proper ring from Ukraine. So, I spent about half n hour to pick a nice ring. 

A football team, and a wrestling team from India ware travelling with me on the same Air India flight. “Things are opening up”, i thought.

![IMG_5136.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20edecee6139204ea59cef3af7572051f8/IMG_5136.jpeg)

Welcome to Russia, we don’t speak English—>

Everyone I had known from Russia till this point spoke at least a little, if not wonderful English like Anna. So, when I came out of the immigration counter, and officially entered Russia, it was a shock that all signs, all boards, and everything else was in Russian. Almost no one spoke English, I was suddenly reduced to sign language while acting out words, rather than properly communicating. I was planning to take the earliest flight to London, but Ash who was constantly on the phone suggested I carry on as planned, it’s not a big deal, he said. I was not so convinced. He asked if Anna was going to come to receive me at the airport? lol. In my wet dreams. I told him she’s crazy like me. 

Google translate was coming really handy during this time. I bought a mobile SIM card. Had three smart phones, so it was not a problem to find a slot. Data availability fine, at good speed.

![This is the registration document for the sim which I lost last year along with the Samsung phone.](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20edecee6139204ea59cef3af7572051f8/image.jpg)

This is the registration document for the sim which I lost last year along with the Samsung phone.

There was a hot high speed train attended who helped me book a train to Moscow. It didn’t matter that she didn’t speak English, I understood everything. 

Moscow—>

The SVO airport itself was pretty modern, and had a kind of zen feeling to it. Maybe, it was because of few passengers due to Covid. 

![SVO airport terminal. This was also my first encounter with Mr. Pushkin’s statue.](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20edecee6139204ea59cef3af7572051f8/IMG_5295.jpeg)

SVO airport terminal. This was also my first encounter with Mr. Pushkin’s statue.

A Starbucks at the train departure terminal was reassuring that I am still in the civilised world. 

The super fast train itself was pretty cool, clean and actually fast. Russian countryside seemed pretty much like English countryside for the sake of drawing comparisons. You know little due, some sunlight. Houses with slanted roofs. Kinda surrounded by a forrest.

The train dropped us at the **Belorussky** train station. I was told to take the metro from the same place for **Leningradsky,** main train station from where I was supposed to catch the train to Tver. I was following her stories, she seemed really excited about the idea of kissing her frog, and the frog was equally if not more excited by that idea. She was also posting little crazy things like her usual self. My baby is a real story teller.

![First Russian sunset.](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20edecee6139204ea59cef3af7572051f8/IMG_5147.jpeg)

First Russian sunset.

I just couldn't find any metro station upon arrival at the **Belorussky** station. Everyone kept telling me that it’s next to the KFC, translated in realtime by Google Translate, but kept going round and round. 

![Moscow is like little America and Europe blended together, but permanently dubbed into Russian language.](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20edecee6139204ea59cef3af7572051f8/IMG_5298.jpeg)

Moscow is like little America and Europe blended together, but permanently dubbed into Russian language.

It turned out that the metro station was like 300 meters away from the railway station. Why doesn’t anyone say that?! Had my confidence back, and it seemed like Moscow was under my seize. lol.

The metro stations from the onset were like you landed in the Star Wars universe. There was so much culture. Like, Darth Vader was just around the next escalator step. I was already having all these movie ideas that we could film there.

![A new hope.](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20edecee6139204ea59cef3af7572051f8/IMG_5152.jpeg)

A new hope.

Seeing a Price Waterhouse Cooper logo above a thick building while walking around the station was also reassuring of Russia being part of the globally bad auditing standards 🤣. 

![IMG_5143.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20edecee6139204ea59cef3af7572051f8/IMG_5143.jpeg)

Finally, reached **Leningradsky—>** this station would become my default hunkering down place being at the centre of everything. You could go to Tver from here or to the airport or access Moscow city, and at the same time it had all kinds of cafe’s, hotels + shops. I feel at ease in such places that are inter connected to everything. This was like Paddington Station or Connaught Place or Pen Station of Moscow.

There was one particular cafe at the station which became my default place to eat and drink. It had fresh vibe, good heating and healthy menu choices. It was not so cold first time around in April, but still chilly.

I had arrived in Moscow in the evening, there was no point in going to TVER in the night, and I had to find a hotel. There were couple of hotels within the station’s east and west sides. The hotel on the east side was more affordable, I only had to spend a night, and spending minimum amount seemed sensible. I was extremely cautious because of Covid, if it’s anywhere you could catch a pandemic, it’s in busy metro or hotel rooms.

This room was right above the station platform, and was quite noisy throughout the night. There was also a lot of noise coming from the adjacent room. I hardly got any sleep. 

None of my social media was active at that point. That was a stupid mistake. Always have your own broadcast ready in this day, and age. Anna was passing time by posting strange stories. One of them was with strays dogs, another something about her frog. I am jumping across the pond baby. Had to share the update with Chikee and Akash. 

I missed the first train in the morning, was getting a bit cold feet. It’s one thing being in Moscow, and whole another to travel to in the middle of nowhere with only a train connecting to rest of the world. Had breakfast at the same cafe, then a tea at another nice cafe right beside the platform. I only started having tea’s after meeting Anna. Missed one more train. It was also quite cold on the open platform, and uncertain as to what exactly I was going to do upon reaching Tver?! This was a stunt, and I had never actually performed stunts like these. Let’s be honest, this would had been a wild stunt even for the most audacious. Then, I mustered up courage, and took the next train. It was a semi high speed rail.

Landing in Tver for the first time was like landing in the middle of no where, slowly walking out of this train small and cozy train station. It didn’t seem ideal to just walk straight up to Anna’s house with luggage. I had booked a hotel with tentative dates within 5 miles of her house.

My only refuges were google maps and google translate. There were some cabs outside the station. I was a little afraid. This part of the town looked a little rough. The cab drivers approached me as I walked towards them, and I got in the back of a run down taxi for 400 Roubles to the hotel. I knew they were ripping me off, but just wanted to get to the hotel. It was still early evening.

![IMG_5171.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20edecee6139204ea59cef3af7572051f8/IMG_5171.jpeg)

The driver hurriedly dropped me at the Lemon Loft hotel, took the money, and ran. This hotel was wonderful, run by all women, almost. It was modern, clean and accessible. A supermarket was within 100 meters. Plenty of flower shops nearby. 

Hotel staff told me about Yandex straight away, which is Russia’s alternative for Uber. In some ways, it was even better than Uber—> speaking about app’s UI, UX and service. Had booked the hotel for one night only, as I thought about moving in with Anna after the kiss 🤷🏽‍♂️.

The room was actually like small a studio apartment with an in built kitchen equipped with a microwave, refrigerator and utensils. I got fresh. Extremely anxious, because it’s a big thing I am about to do! This was forever going to change our lives. Literally. I had never proposed to a girl for marriage. I knew that’s what she wanted.

![IMG_5177.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20edecee6139204ea59cef3af7572051f8/IMG_5177.jpeg)

Maybe, it’s some psychological effect, but I felt a familiarity about the place. Sure, I was a stranger, but walking around on the streets, it didn’t feel new or strange. I walked up to a flower shop about 400 meters from the hotel, and a bouquet made of 9 roses, because it was not too expensive and looked good. The flower shop lady was very nice. We mostly spoke through google translate. It was already apparent that they don’t get many foreign tourist in this town.

Booked a cab via Yandex, and on my way to Anna’s house. 

![IMG_2446.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20edecee6139204ea59cef3af7572051f8/IMG_2446.jpeg)

The cab is being driven by a middle aged man, he immediately notices the flowers in my hands. I was looking outside the window of the car, it’s still early in the evening, trying to work through anxiousness. Looking at the map on the Yandex app, and google maps in btw. My hearts almost in my mouth as we take a turn on her street. I had looked up at an older version of this street on google earth which had communal bath on the corner which had been replaced by a supermarket. I knew her house is kinda green, there’s a tree on the opposite side of the street and a water channel from the Volga flowing from the front. 

The cab finally arrived, and he just didn’t leave me, but parked the cab under the tree. Like, “I want to see what happens.” lol. 

I collected the flowers, the right, the phone and my heart in one breath. Got out of the car. The curtain was not on the window. That means she’s home. I called her while walking towards the door, but she did not pick up the call! I don’t know, that was just a red flag. All my senses saying to step back. I asked the cab driver to drive me back to the hotel. But he just left while saying something in Russian. Google translate is not that fast. But maybe he was telling me to book another cab.

It didn’t seem appropriate to stand in front of the house, so I walked towards the bus stop at the end of the street towards the left, joining with the main street.

I called Chikee, and also messaged Charu. Why didn’t she pick up the call?! And why is she not calling back?! I was just really anxious and wanted to be in contact with someone. Both of them asked me the strangest thing possible at the time—> “did you ring the door bell?” Like, WTF?! I called her on the phone! But both of them kept asking me to ring the bell of the house. Why can’t see just call back? Or text me?! 

![IMG_5172.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20edecee6139204ea59cef3af7572051f8/IMG_5172.jpeg)

I have flowers in my hand, buses are coming and going. People are looking. I don’t care, but at the same time I don’t know what the vibe here?! A foreigner standing at a random bus stop with a bunch of roses. Phone’s battery is getting really low. But both of them kept telling me to ring the door bell! 

![IMG_5173.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20edecee6139204ea59cef3af7572051f8/IMG_5173.jpeg)

Had to find a place to charge my phone. Chikee was on call this whole time. When I walked back to the bus stop, I saw someone looking like Anna from behind in a pink upper on a video call, walking towards the house! She was right there! She was almost in front of the house when i had noticed, opened a side door and disappeared inside! I told Chikee about seeing her. He again asked me to ring the door bell of the house! I was not going to ring the bell till she texted or called back! 

About 2 hours were spent doing this, it was getting cold, phone’s battery was constantly struggling. Had to get back to the hotel. I was in touch with everyone that was an available. This was unacceptable. I mean common. What are we doing here, I thought? They kept trying to convince me to ring the door bell. I am already all the way here in the middle of no where all the way from India, while taking a detour from London and went right up to her front door, but it’s not enough?! Oh, I am aware about her obsession with perfection. But, really? What do I need to climb the chimney next?! And, then what?! This is not the tie to cold feet. It’s fine if she was overwhelmed but you gotta work through it.

Anyway, I booked a cab again, and on the way to her place with the roses in tow. Anxious. The house lights were off. It was dark outside. Either she was not at home or was not going to respond. Asked the cab driver to turn around, and drive back to the hotel. This ride had not finished, so he had no problem. 

Quite an eventful day 1? 

I ordered some food from Russian version of food delivery app. They did not have English as a language option, so it was quite difficult to figure out the menus. I took screenshots, then translated, somehow it worked out. Like already noted, the hotel was not in the town centre, i was tired and didn’t feel like going out. Could not sleep.

Chikee and Charu had raised their hands. It’s crazy, i thought. Ash told me to text her, and see what happens. I did text her, and she responded by asking “If it’s a joke?.” She couldn’t believe her dream man was here! Said that she’ll be downtown in half n hour. “I don’t know where down town is, but if you give me an address, i will get there.” She sent me location of Cafe Buna Buna. It was only my third day in Russia, and still within 24 hours in Tver. How would I know about down town?! Got a cab to this place.

It was like in the movies, a charming foreigner comes to a small town and the whole place is lighted up with immense joy 🤩. On the inside, i was still anxious, i had been anxious since the day I met Annie, because i didn’t want to lose her at any cost. Didn’t order anything, and waited about half n hour at the cafe, before she arrived. It was like every character from Harry Potter, and all the magical movie universes had assembled at this cafe. This was nothing like the rough and “dangerous Russia” I was told about by everyone. This cafe could have been anywhere in the world.

Clearly, she was equally, if not more anxious as she came wearing every gift I had ever bought for her 🥰🤣. It was not even subtle. All at the same time. Like the cutest spec of light in the whole universe. I kept looking at her like the centre of all my attention. She was wearing a white dress with some blue things. I was trying to act cool, but for fuck sake she was being so formal like we were on the sets of Pride and Prejudice, while i just wanted to grab her right there, put on the cafe counter and kiss out all my frustrations out of intimacy, not lust. But I had to act civil. We placed our orders for americano and tea. She was talking constantly, but I could not really hear much for the first new minutes as we settled back on our spots.

Anna was still mad about me calling her out on her narcissism, back in December! She clearly likes playing role of a teacher in real life as well, and being authoritative. She wanted me to “correct my mistake” via WhatsApp text. I asked “right now? You want me to send you an apology text right now?” She insisted. I thought it was kinda cute, but also totally unnecessary. Why can’t she chill about anything? It’s middle of April, and we already had Valentine’s Day in btw and my birthday. I also wanted to speak to her about some of the idiots she was in touch with other than myself, both from India and Russia. Also, the text I had sent in December was all true, so I would need to make up some lie now, sitting in front of her. Like i said, it was cuteness galore, so I did it. She was happy, it was worth it. 

I remember her taking note, and being kinda impressed when I paid the cafe by Apple Pay.

Detour—>

I just don’t like being too formal. To act via protocol because “you have to.” It’s sooo weird unless you are in the army, because there you have to maintain rank, and file. Also, i like to be thorough while writing protocols, while most of the formality protocols leave half of the stuff to your best guess. Nothing specific to do with this situation, but just saying.

Another magical walk—>

I bought a new bouquet of flowers for her as the one from previous night had gone bad. She did not accept it initially.

After i sent the text, she said that we should move, so we did. As soon as we stepped out of the cafe, she gestured for the bouquet of flowers, and I gave it to her. She liked it. Blushing.

I was just following her lead as we walked through the city centre, she kept giving me little details about city’s history. 

We went through the main round about at the city centre, quite European in its architecture. There was a church, a restaurant, other stuff, all looking at a tree. As we came to the zebra crossing, she said “the cars stop here to let you cross the street”, and we walked onto the other side. I kept hearing her voice every time after while crossing this street, alone. 

We came over to this statue of the former king of Tver on a horse with few benches around and sat down. Internally, I was really tired, but my senses were at such ease because of her wonderful energy, it didn’t feel tiring. She was telling me about her mum, and how she had fights with her in the pandemic. I felt a bit sorry for her mum. lol. Then she told me about doing push ups to keep strong, that felt like a warning for me! I am already scared, sweetheart. lol. I have no power over her, other than love, none at all. She can kill me, and I won’t be able to do anything to her. That’s why I am scared when she tries to exert artificial power moves out of her insecurity, because I feel helpless, absolutely powerless. What will I do? Take an even bigger sigh?

This photo was on the third trip in September/ October.

We were still sitting at the benches when she told me about the bicycle trip with her mum, and how she called this friend mid way, he came to pick her up. “I have such friends” She said. I had already read about this in her instagram stories, and this was a retelling of it, word for word, as she had written It there! That’s strange, i thought. But didn’t say anything as I was just trying to impress upon her with my maturity and husband material qualities 🤷🏽‍♂️.

We carried on with our walk. Stopped by Taun, as she had to use the washroom. Held the door. You know, trying to be a gentleman for my lady. That’s not formality, but etiquettes.

There was a heavily graffitied door on the way to the river side, she wanted it to be painted perfectly, and i thought scrappiness is culture. We started talking about languages when I mentioned nothing here is labelled in English—> “because, we were not a British colony” she said. True. The conversation went to languages of Uttar Pradesh as she thought some of her Indian friends were from there, but they were from further northeast. We spoke about people getting confused between languages and dialects, at times. There was a little playground on the right, though we turned left and kept walking alongside the river.

![This river front photo was taken during the second trip in May.](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20edecee6139204ea59cef3af7572051f8/IMG_5946.jpeg)

This river front photo was taken during the second trip in May.

We came to a really old single screen cinema. Like i said, this whole town is designed like one of those Stranger Things towns from American television series, but with a European, and obviously Russian touch. More of that, later.

There was a park on the way, we were just talking about stuff in general. About her work, about my work, and came upon the Main street, this was the same street we had crossed earlier at the round about, but a little further ahead. 

Anna mentioned seeing her boss, and how he would make a complaint about her not being at work. she wanted to leave suddenly. A bus came at the same time, she had to catch it. I just wanted to hold on to her. She had invited to me to her English speaking club, and said will text me the details. She looked joyous, like beaming with light. It was the afternoon, but still. Beautiful like ever. Ran towards the bus, I just kept looking. Couldn’t stand her not being with me even for that little while. I was like, what should I do now?

It didn’t occurred that i should take a cab back to the hotel. Especially, when sleep deprived, and tired. Just started walking. Ash called or i called him, told him how great it went. He seemed happy in my happiness, while taking all the credit for asking me to send the text in the morning. Of course. lol. I was just really missing her already. 

On the walk back to the hotel, again, every aspect of this town felt familiar from some memories. Most probably based on American television. The little bridge over another water body, the supermarkets, the colour arrangements. The arrangement of the city centre. It’s like i had landed on a movie set of a film I had watched so many times. 

Finished some work while in the room. I was sleep deprived, but not sleepy, if that makes sense? Anna texted me the location while mentioning in a voice message that people at the club are intrigued by my personality, and that I’ll be the star of the evening. I told her about being scared and feeling the pressure of the test, and how in nervousness my accent changed to Caribbean dialect. It was passive aggressive which meant “I know what you are doing, and I am not actually scared.” She tried to calm be down by saying she knows I don’t like attention, its no pressure, but genuine interest. 

Told her it’s fine, all directors are failed actors, and secretly love attention. 

I wanted to pick her up from her place, but also didn’t want to seem too pushy, wanted to give her space. Got to the location first. It was a lovely cafe on the same street as Buna Buna, but a little further ahead. Texted Anna. She told me to go inside, and about being 2 mins away. 

[Coffee Love.Co - Google Search](https://g.co/kgs/LU4LrWK)

Started speaking to the people who were already there. They knew about me, obviously. But at the same time giving much attention. Felt a bit staged. Few of them like Egor, Artem and Sophia used to work at Accenture branch in Tver itself. They slightly rearranged the tables.

![The English club night was in the evening. This photo was taken on the second trip in May.](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20edecee6139204ea59cef3af7572051f8/IMG_5926.jpeg)

The English club night was in the evening. This photo was taken on the second trip in May.

Anna came wearing the last gift I had sent her, the only thing she had not worn earlier today. She was looking too cute. The necklace didn’t match much with anything. Too cute. She sat beside Egor, right opposite me, next to the wall/ window. 

I was just trying to make jokes to make them and myself feel comfortable. We were sitting in two groups, one on out table, and another on the table behind us. We ordered some drinks. Anna was trying to make me jealous by fake flirting with Egor. Somehow, I got in a little conversation with Sophia, that made Anna angry, and Sophia had to change seats. We all knew what was happening. It was fine. They asked how did we meet, and I was just making jokes. The conversation went from there to somewhere about life, and then back to that topic. Anna and me were eye locked on several occasions. 

Someone suggested that we move to another place for dinner. As we stepped out she was really concerned, and slightly annoyed that I didn’t bring my jacket. I was just trying to be hip, it was not so cold in the day time, it was stupid of me.

We were all walking in close proximity. Me, Anna, an Egor were alongside, talking about life in Tver, and how’s he working at Accenture. He told us about his family. I was just trying to make sure he’s not sleeping with my women 😭 🤷🏽‍♂️. We landed at an Irish Bar. I used to visit The Irish House a lot in Mumbai, as it was a good place to work from with amazing food. So, this was another familiar thing. As we’re about to enter the restaurant, rounding up a conversation about living nomadically, not owning a house—> “we should think about that” Anna said.

We all settled by putting some tables together. Anna was sitting right beside me, Egor in the centre, Sophia on my other side, Artem further down, in total about 12 people. The menu was in Russian language, I looked at Anna for help. She seemed a little reluctant. Anyway, I ordered an old fashioned, and a Greek salad. I was really tired, just enjoying the drink. She asked if I was not going to finish the salad? “After finishing the drink” I told her. Don’t remember what she ordered, but she looked a little concerned anytime I would talk to Sophia. Eventually, she wanted to leave because the vibe was not great, I didn’t care either, and wanted to make her feel comfortable. She handled the communication to sort out our bill, and I paid. As we were leaving, Artem wanted to say bye to her with a hug that went a few seconds too long, if you ask me. lol. Leave her alone, she’s mine. Mine. I didn’t say that, of course.

It was around 11.30ish or even 12’o clock at that time. I was pretty much brain dead, only able to move due to my beating heart. lol. We were just talking about random stuff, i tried telling her about the fake colonel, but she didn’t want to hear about him. I tried to bring up the media in btw our silence like Shakey, and neither of us wanted to talk about him. We were in front of her college, she told me about getting a diploma from there, and her time in Belgium. She doesn’t really want to teach, and all. I asked her about Egor’s name by referring to him as “that tall guy”, she suggested that we use pet names for everyone. Sure, that’s a lot of fun, i thought.

The streets were completely empty, like in South Bombay. It was getting cold, I should have carried the jacket. We went to a super market which was right opposite the Irish Bar. She wanted to buy orange juice. I didn’t buy anything, but I wanted to grab, and kiss her as we stepped out of the cafe. Other than being tired, I was scared of her 😕. I was just trying to be too perfect for her, she had mentioned about not liking being touched without permission, which probably didn’t apply in that moment, but whatever. 

it had been about 1.5 hours of us walking. “Why are you here?” She asked. “For you, I love you” I said. She didn’t say anything, kept walking, and looked her usual suspicious self. Okay.

We settled on a bench at the river front at approx. 1.30 in the night. It was chilly. She was taking sips of her juice. I tried sliding close to her, like our hips and legs were in touch. lol. She seemed a little stiff. It was not like, “come grab hold of me” kinda body language, but it was also not make some room kinda vibe either. It was what it was. She started talking about my “psychological issues” in the cold, at 1.30 am, at the river front. 

I was like “have you ever seen a psychological mirror.” 

“i don’t need another one like myself” She said.

“It’s not like that, we will make it work, it will be different.” I said

She said something else, i retorted something about her own issues. She clearly did not like that remark, and shifted slightly away from me to the left of the bench. “Why are we talking about this stuff right now?” I thought. “We should take it slow, and there’s a boundary”, She said. What, really?! I thought. She noticed I was shivering in the cold, and suggested that we should move. Thank god! 

We were on our way to Taun in silence. It’s the same restaurant we had stopped by in the afternoon to use the washroom. I was still shivering. I could feel the tension in the air, but didn’t think it was anything serious. The interim engagement ring was in the small pouch above my pants right pocket. As we were like 5 meters away from Taun, she said something, and finished it by saying “What will I get from this?” 

Never expected that question. 

I was silent. 

“You should say something.” She said with kind of helpless authority.

“Give me sometime, I am thinking” I replied lol 

I had no idea what she was talking about! She didn’t even provide any multiple choices options! 😭

So, I kept repeating this in my head “what will she get out of this?” There could have been infinite possible answers to this question, and I only have limited compute, especially at that time in the night 🤣

If she was not already pissed, now she was, but I was unaware about the importance of this question. It didn’t feel like the right time to bring out the interim ring either.

We settled into the restaurant corner table, and ordered some tea. The vibe had clearly shifted. I knew the trouble is imminent.

It was about 2am in the night. Russian time. My internal body clocks are a weird paradox of Indian and UK time. That’s why I need two sleeps.

For some reason, we started speaking about my solitude as an artist. “I don’t believe in that” she said. Fine. It’s not an out belief. I am not a recluse, and like being social. Even spotlight. Solitude does not mean you want to be alone or ghosted, but a certain way of conducting yourself while working on different things—> hence, the requirement of boundaries. Not random “boundaries” upon hearing anything that sounds self reflective. There were small words, and things she mentioned which were giving away sources of her arguments, it was not all coming from herself, but from Charu and Shakey. Some other people as well. I could connect the dots.

“You think, you know anything about Psychology?” She said, extremely disparagingly.

Hmm

From the internet. Please get in touch for credit.

The conversation shifted to her relationships. 

She asked me to make a guess about the abuser in her life. 

I didn’t want to. It didn’t seem appropriate. But she insisted.

“You ex husband?” I said.

“No. He was a very nice person.” 

“Your father? What are we talking about?” I asked

“It’s me. I AM The abuser.” She said with a lot of pain hidden behind an overconfident outlook. 

She was constantly receiving messages on her phone at this time, and replying back. 

We continued the conversation, and I said “You will have to Figure out what you want from this, yourself.” That’s part of being independent and free! I don’t want to define what you shall get. You decide. That was my answer in the moment.

She replied by saying “maybe, come back to me in 5 years.” That was exact repeat of Charu’s words, when she thought I was into her, but I was not.

“Fine, I will stay here for one more day, and leave for Moscow as I already have a ticket to London.” I replied knowing she’s just bluffing.

“That’s upto you” She said while did not looking happy.

“True that” I replied 

Suddenly, she started making strange faces, and weird body language.

“What are you doing?” I asked

“I don’t feel safe.” She said

“You don’t feel safe?!” I asked

“I am calling a cab for myself, and I am going to leave.“ She replied.

I tried to convince her, to calm down. It’ll be different, but she was adamant. Not listening to anything.

Got up to pay the bill at the counter. I followed her. 

Tried to make the payment, but she used Google Pay with the same flamboyance I had shown in the afternoon at Buna Buna.

“I am done” She said.

Too tired to make sense of anything. 

I followed her to the cab. 

“Goodbye Hug?” I asked with all the energy and I had inside.

She refused.

“Can I text you?” 

She made a bad face, and got inside the cab. 

Didn’t want to make a scene. Thought about getting a cab to her home. But, I was anyway in an alien place. 

Her cab drove away. As I kept looking at the distance at about 2.30am in the night.

Like, someone had dislodged my whole world out of its axis. It really felt that disorienting. It was suddenly a whole different universe. I could feel the dread.

I got my stuff from the table. It felt really strange. Got a cab back to the hotel. Could not sleep rest of the time. I was waiting to get in touch with people to figure things out.

That was the point of the wound really opening up. I was no longer in the mood of listening like a psychologist in the corner of the hotel cafe, but wanting to talk. To speak my mind. 

After that night—>

In any situation, it’s never only one persons fault. I could have said or done things differently as well. At the same time, I was really annoyed of her keep dong this thing of leaving me in the middle, rather than listening, taking time to think, and figuring things out. I was breathing heavy while night. 

I was primarily talking to Chikee, Charu and Ash. Also, with Ashwin, in btw. 

Anything, I was saying, and texting to Chikee, and Charu was not “behind Anna’s back”, but knowing that these people are in touch with her. I was really texting to Anna, through them. Chikee was in touch through Shakey, and Ashwin probably thought Chikee. Whatever. I had to put all the unfiltered feelings, out there.

Anna had not blocked me yet. So, I could have messaged her as well. Though, she had said “no” while leaving that night when I asked about texting her.

I have already explained Charu’s problems, she was thinking I am emotionally confiding to her, but that was not the case. I had made a comment about Anna probably doing the same thing in her previous marriage to her. A whole day passed into all of this, I caught some sleep. Next day, Anna posted a long Instagram post where the word revenge was mentioned. I had to block Charu. 

Chikee said maybe I should speak to Frank. So, he also got involved. I already knew he was in this WhatsApp group from a message from him few months ago. Anyway, it did felt calming speaking to Frank, but he suggested I should move to Bali, and become a blogger. lol. “You are not a husband, Buddy. There are better things to do” Said Frank. After convincing him that she’s the girl and, it’s serious, he suggested to make a life plan. Even Ash suggested that Anna wanted me to propose her for marriage when she asked “What will I get form this?.” How am I supposed to know that at 2am? I thought. I got an interim ring already, and the main ring could be here anytime from Ukraine if we get the size of her ring finger. 

It felt a bit of a drag to write a fuckin “life plan.” Who does that?! We make a plan, and god makes other plan sort of thing. Anyway, I wrote a proposed life plan.

![IMG_0486.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20edecee6139204ea59cef3af7572051f8/IMG_0486.jpeg)

![That’s the printed version I was going to send Anna, but didn’t.](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20edecee6139204ea59cef3af7572051f8/image%201.jpg)

That’s the printed version I was going to send Anna, but didn’t.

It’s our life plan, not only mine. Therefore, some of the things like ceremony, and car are based on what she would want, as well. It does not make any exuberant claims, other than plans in development, and aspirations. I had Frank read it, and he liked it. 

I took a print out from the reception, and the front desk lady who had become friendly also thought its fine. I found a new flower shop, it’s a small town, maybe everyone knows everyone. I don’t know. Whatever. Cool. I was going to put it in with the flowers, but it just feel right. We shouldn’t get married based on some plan. What if the plan fails?! Marriage is a commitment base don love. “You did the right thing, Buddy.” Frank said when I told him about sending the flowers on its own.

Anna got the flowers, and texted me like she’s angry. But clearly she was doing a melodrama.

“You go back, there’s nothing to say. I’ll be fine here alone, on my own.” 

We exchanged few messages. I apologised to her, even though I shouldn’t have.

Pleading to meet me once. So, that I could propose her, and correct the mistake of that night.

She’s playing it more, and more. I sent her a photo of the ring. She immediately blocked me.

![6858CD05-4156-4CDB-B404-1964804DAF06.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20edecee6139204ea59cef3af7572051f8/6858CD05-4156-4CDB-B404-1964804DAF06.jpeg)

She can’t keep doing this! I thought. Shakey’s directly in touch with her, so I messaged him to make her unblock me. Some of the stuff I was saying to him was melodrama. “I can’t force her bro, she’ll block me as well. it’ll affect our friendship.” of course I know that you idiot. 

That same day, Ash and Chico tell me that I don’t have a job in London. You have to be kidding me. They were not going to help with Steve either. That’s just bullshit. I already have tickets. It does not matter. “You don’t have a job here if you come.” Ash told me. At some point after coming back from London, I had joked with Ash about inheriting his wealth. Chico had been acting mean, and strange to me ever since. It’s not my fault if you don’t understand jokes. 

So, I don’t have an extra income, and she’s acting high maintenance all the time. I can’t catch a fucking break, as if the whole universe has actually turned inside out. In the meanwhile, all everyone in the middle would tell me is to go knock on her door, and propose. 

We probably need to have a conversation about the current financial situation. I thought. I don’t want to keep her in any illusion or lie to her. Most of the doors to near future financial prosperity seemed slammed on my face, pretty much. It takes time to get things going. Only thing I had was this remote job which was not much on its own to sustain a flourishing life style. She won’t have anything less than that. If we grind out few months, than one of the things could workout to provide stability to our personal lives, I thought. 

But we need to have this conversation like mature adults. Not like characters from Pride and Prejudice. 

I kept sending her flowers from a flower shop near the Buna Buna cafe. She accepted them as well. Days were passing by, I am on a limited Visa and don’t know what is she doing? I am not proposing without a conversation, and she should unblock me first. It’s enough of this childishness. There’s a huge difference between being child like, and being childish.

As far as I was concerned, I was still going to London from here to figure out extra revenue streams. Also, because I had already booked tickets to London. It made sense to stay there for a month, and then book a flight to India, rather than cancel the current flight, and book another flight back to India directly from Russia. Ash was not ready to reimburse me for that flight to London either. It was ridiculous of them to do this, knowing the situation I was in, at that time. 

Third time I sent the flowers from the same flower lady, she said that Anna was reluctant in taking the flowers, and there was another man at her house. Her brother, I asked? She didn’t know. Now, I definitely don’t have to go propose. It’s not the time to play games. She was posting some stories which showed that she was in a fun mood, perhaps. Situation on my side was not that great.

I told Chikee that it feels creepy to go to her house when I have been told about someone being there, and she’s not even unblocking me. Maybe, I should leave? He almost fought with me, saying I should definitely not leave, and I should go propose. My phone’s battery went down. She should unblock, and we should have a conversation. Let her feel some pressure, I thought. 

Sent another bouquet of flowers that morning with a quote from Leonard Cohen—>

> **We are human.** **We want to love, and someone must forgive us for the paths we take to love, for the paths are many and dark, and we are ardent and cruel in our journey.**
> 

This was to acknowledge both of our mistakes till now in dealing with this stuff, and to forgive each other to make a fresh start together.

I don’t know what she heard from Chikee about me leaving, and what she constituted from this quote. But when I connected my phone back to the hot stop from the other phone, there were couple of WhatsApp messages from her. 

First one abusing me like a little girl, saying she does not like my “unwanted gifts”, calling me a little creep, what not?! I am shocked. It’s repeating most of the stuff I had been saying to Chikee and others. She’s clearly trying to communicate something. That is cute, i thought.

I had not seen her first message because of not being connected to the internet. But there was a second message with a difference of about half n hour—>

> “You know what, little creep. I’ve tolerated enough. All the pain/inconvenience/anger/shame you’ve caused me, gonna get back to you in double. I’m mirroring it back to you. Enjoy my farewell gift from Russia. One way or another u’ll learn to respect women and the rules of the human kingdom. Take care…u’ll need it.”
> 

I was in the Tver, City Centre while reading this message. Got scared reading that! Even if it’s a misunderstanding, people do crazy things all the time by mistake. Ash said “live to fight another day.” That sounded right. Amy also said the same thing, in the moment. I used Ash’s card as it was handy to book a train ticket which was only approx Roubles 550.00 leaving within half n hour, and got a cab back to the hotel. He deducted that amount from my wages. This is escape from Tver. Last thing I want is unecessary trouble when I came here for love! When did I disrespect any woman, by the way? What rules of humanity did I break?

Somehow, I convinced the cab driver to stay as I retrieve my bag from the hotel. She knew my hotel. What if that man flower lady told me about is here?! I don’t know. Used my senses, got the bag. Cab dropped me at the train station. Kept reading her messages throughout the journey back to Moscow.

![IMG_5312.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20edecee6139204ea59cef3af7572051f8/IMG_5312.jpeg)

I can’t blame Chikee really, if that’s how she handles pressure. If I caused her pain/inconvenience/anger/shame then why not speak to me about it. We can talk about it like adults. My flight to London was in about 3 days. I was still blocked. She had posted couple of stories which were hilarious from Lord of the rings, asking “her army” to bring Gollum, as in me, back to her 🤣😭

![IMG_0487.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20edecee6139204ea59cef3af7572051f8/IMG_0487.jpeg)

Well, not the best of ways to apologise or make up. Also, couple of other stories were evident of her crying. What do you want me to do? Why its so complicated?! 

At the same time, I am thinking what’s getting lost in translation? Maybe, its this—>

![IMG_2808.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20edecee6139204ea59cef3af7572051f8/IMG_2808.jpeg)

I got a hotel at Leningradsky railway station itself, but this time on the west side. This room was much more modern, and comfortable.

![IMG_5273.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20edecee6139204ea59cef3af7572051f8/IMG_5273.jpeg)

This was the view from the hotel room.

It had been only one night here in Moscow. I was still keeping in touch with Frank, and others to figure things out. Also, thinking of going back to Tver if Anna had unblocked me on WhatsApp, but she didn’t. 

I texted Laura Wilson. Seemed like the thing to do if I was going to London. Told her about being caught up in psychological warfare. She again didn’t finish the conversation, just stopped replying. What demon had caught her?! 😫

My visa was only valid till 27th April. Flight to London was booked for that day as well. But If I was to go back to India then there was only one flight leaving on the 25th April, and the next available flight was on 29th April—> that would mean staying after expiry of the Visa. There were no other flights in between. If you over stay in Russia, they do a court case on you, rather than deportation! I didn’t want either situation to play out!

Re started the conversation with Ash and Chico on the morning of 25th April, they were adamant in denial. At one point, he even said that he never agreed to the job! That was not true at all. Why do I have these bangles?! We kept debating for a while, I asked them to refund the ticket, they declined that as well. 

Chico was specially saying stuff that didn’t make any sense. I had been with this company from the onset, when she was working at his cafe, I was applying for accreditations. Not only did I deserve incentives, but this was an agreed deal. There was no time left to waste anymore, we had been talking since the morning. Immediately, I booked the tickets for the Air India flight leaving that same evening.

![IMG_0488.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20edecee6139204ea59cef3af7572051f8/IMG_0488.jpeg)

Checked out of the hotel. Took a cab instead of the train as I didn’t want to miss the flight. Filled the e-suvidha form on the way.

![IMG_5327.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20edecee6139204ea59cef3af7572051f8/IMG_5327.jpeg)

Chico sent me a lengthy message on WhatsApp making strange accusations, and just random nonsense. I sent the message to Ash, and asked him to stop all this. He was apologetic. 

First thing, I had to give a Covid test at the airport itself. I chose the fastest test which was going to be available in 60 mins. This shall explain the rest—>

![IMG_0490.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20edecee6139204ea59cef3af7572051f8/IMG_0490.jpeg)

Note the time on the report, and the departure time on the flight. Facts.

The Russian representative at the Air India counter at SVO was not at all helpful. She said “We have rules.” I pleaded with her, explained about the visa situation, but it was of no use. There was another passenger at the counter in the same situation. He was also not able to board the flight.

![IMG_5281.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20edecee6139204ea59cef3af7572051f8/IMG_5281.jpeg)

I never got the refund. So, not only I was losing money on the Moscow to London flight, but also this flight. Back at the hotel in Leningadrsky. First, I tried speaking to the Visa service which provided me with an invitation letter required to apply for a tourist visa for Russia. They said I am in deep shit, and they can’t help. 

![She’s quoting my name wrongly or a typo in that email.](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20edecee6139204ea59cef3af7572051f8/IMG_0501.jpeg)

She’s quoting my name wrongly or a typo in that email.

I was not worried, called the Indian embassy, a Russian woman named Marta was really kind, and booked an appointment for me to visit them next day for a Visa extension. I was pretty much out of pocket, but had to book another ticket from Moscow to Delhi for 29th of April. Ash said he doesn’t want to mess me up! lol. He sent the next month’s wages as advance. Well, let’s just say that was not a favour. Other than the flights, I also had to pay extra for the extended hotel stay. 

![IMG_5325.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20edecee6139204ea59cef3af7572051f8/IMG_5325.jpeg)

The next day, I went to the Indian Embassy. It was raining. Marta was really nice even in person. I had to face couple of Indian officials who tried to “interrogate”, just doing their job, i guess. Then she presented me to the Indian high commissioner, he heard my explanation, looked at the ticket booking for 25th April, 27th April and 29th April, and sent the request to the Russian authorities to issue the visa extension. He called someone on the phone.

![IMG_5302.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20edecee6139204ea59cef3af7572051f8/IMG_5302.jpeg)

Marta put in a good word for me through all this. She helped me fill the form as it was in Russian language. “He’s only a tourist, doesn’t know anything” She said…aawww. True. I had to put in some money into their account as fees to process the extension.

Who says I can’t multitask? During all this, i thought its stupid to leave Russia without getting laid. Relationship didn’t seem to be going anywhere, Anna had still not unblocked me. All the middle men were getting movie version narration of these events. I powered up Tinder+ membership as you could only look on a free membership, not get laid. It was a trauma reaction of sorts. I wanted to feel my worth after being treated like a dumpster.

![I had bought this candy in the morning from the station. Natalie also had this same candy cover as one of the images on her Tinder profile.](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20edecee6139204ea59cef3af7572051f8/4D700EC6-6E47-4A35-8580-2542D945779F.jpeg)

I had bought this candy in the morning from the station. Natalie also had this same candy cover as one of the images on her Tinder profile.

This app went off like bonkers. I had like 15 to 20 leads within an hour of going live on Tinder+, and 3 dates upon quick conversations. One of them was an Air Hostess. We were supposed to meet at Costa Coffee at the railway station itself, in the afternoon. I was few minutes late, but couldn’t recognise her among all the people sitting there. Took a seat, texted her, she texted back saying she’s there. I was talking to ash or Frank about Anna. Saw a woman overhearing the conversation, then getting up to leave. Think that was her. I can’t catch a fuckin break! lol. Maybe, we exchanged couple of more texts. 

In the evening, I was meeting Natalie, an English teacher. Even taller than Anna. Hot! We met at a regular cafe, but then shifted to a fancy bakery upon her recommendation. She ordered a whole cake for us to share. I was a little afraid based on the stories, but Natalie seemed fine. She told me about her pandemic affair with a some guy in South Africa. She moved in with him, they were living together, but had different ideas about life, it didn’t workout. I was in good form, but Anna was all over my mind. Kept talking about her, even showed her the ring I had bought. Clearly, “this is not going to work if I don’t stop talking about Anna”, I thought. But, it seemed out of my control. Natalie was a good listener like myself. It was a bit late in the night. She let me pay, which is always a good sign. We decided to walk to the metro station through some famous park. Her being too tall was bothering me. Never felt that with Anna, because the height difference was not much.

Natalie helped me realise that Anna was waiting for me to propose to her for the marriage. Sure, the ways were not subtle, but it’s true love, and that I have to go back.

On the metro, we were standing facing each other. I told her about having a hotel room. lol. She smiled, and said “Let me know how it works out with Anna.” It was a sweet encounter. We shared telegram, and stayed in touch.

Third date was supposed to be an Epidemiologist. She wanted to take a long walk in Moscow. I couldn’t commit to it. She seemed like a fine person in texts, but I had a lot going on. We also stayed in touch on telegram. 

The next day, I decided to go to Tver. Randomly met a girl going to Tver as well, at the cafe next to the platform. There was only one day left for when i had to visit SVO airport for Visa extension, and couldn’t make myself move without being blocked. Like common. This girl wanted to take a selfie, fine we did that. Exchanged telegram. Small town and all, thought it will be good to have a contact. She was a bit goth. Blue hair. Told Frank about her “Be careful, buddy, it’s Russia” He said.

I asked Chikee multiple times to come clean about this whole thing, but he didn’t listen. So, I was going to have a bit of fun of my own with these people. Told him about being caught by the KGB, and them asking me to find a blue phone as part of a secret mission. lol. He would just believe anything. If you tell him the earth is flat, he’s walking to its edge. Anna posted few stories being concerned, just not enough to unblock and talk to me. Frank tried to get in touch. Ha ha. Why don’t you all just stop with all this ghosting nonsense? Fine. Lets play.

Taken at SVO airport.

I reached the Airport on the 27th April to get the visa extended. Found the Blue Phone pretty easily. lol. It was not a secret phone. The official on the other side asked me to come to a specific area, and wait for someone.

I was told to come back next day on 28th April as the visa was still valid, and they couldn’t issue the extension till it expires. Okay! What if they don’t?! We will see, i thought.

There were plenty of hotels around the airport, i booked The Holiday Inn on a terrific rate via a completely unknown website called SnapTravels. The ghost gang thought I was in custody 🤣.

The breakfast was fine. Staff noticed my iPad and three phones. They asked if I was doing something with Bitcoins? lol. I wished. Hmm but what do they know? 

I was back at terminal F to meet the duty counsel on time as per the advise. They took the passport, and 2 people came back after about 45 min with the stamped VISA. “You have 3 more days to explore now?” One of them asked. I knew they were scoping if I would get on the flight as per the ticket, and assured them about wanting to take the flight without any funny stuff. They handed the passport to me with a smile.

Spent the rest of the day at the Airport as the flight was early morning, and didn’t want to spend money on a hotel.

Took another Covid test for this flight. That was another added cost.

I was still this moment. But the realisation came from within that I’m leaving something important behind. A sudden dread. I felt alone. By the time it came to boarding the flight, I could not help, and started crying. I had not cried for a while. Had Ash on the phone, asked if I should go to Tver, there was still 2 days left on the visa, and a flight available on 29th April. He obviously advised to take this flight, it was too late. I just did not want to leave, any proximity to Anna is better than none. Never been this down while boarding a flight, didn’t want to leave without her.

Back in India, this wave of Covid was at its peak. Almost everything was shut down. It was worse than before. 

Ghost gang did not know that I was India for a few days. May 1 to May 10 were holidays in Russia, i tried applying for a visa, but could not get through.

Got back in touch with Chikee and Frank. Told them I was making arrangements to go back. Frank was asking me to be cautious. Chikee was on a different tangent by now. But, a promise is a promise. I had said that I was going to come back to Anna, and I was determined to keep my promise. Last thing I wanted to do was to break her heart, she could break mine, it’s fine, thats what it means to love.

There were no easy transport options or anything in India working properly because of Covid. News of relatives catching the virus, and struggling were rampant. Someone needed a really expensive medicine, brother drove the car, and I hand delivered it to a Covid hospital in GK2. Don’t know if some of it was staged. Did not understand why were people taking CT Scan test as a precaution for Covid?! The land owner lady who used to live on the 3rd floor with her old American husband died of Covid in the meanwhile. That was a shock. That made me value love even more, because everything the old lady valued on ground was left behind.

There was a lot of such stupid info that kept coming up. Seemed like society was turning its ugly face, and exploiting each other even at this time of common and general threat, instead of earnestly helping fellow human beings. I look at facts, logic, and not get deterred without reason—> my plans were firm. You need to believe in love at times like these, not give up.

Spoke to the Russian visa centre in New Delhi. As everything was shut, they advised to apply for visa by post, and keep in touch via email. That sounded right, did that. It worked out.

Anna was giving away her puzzle set in the meanwhile, and Shakey bought it. It was all posted on her stories. She sent the parcel to his address in Chhattisgarh. Like, whatever. lol. This desperate idiot has been trying to take advantage of the situation to get close to her. She knew he’s desperate, and rest shall be apparent. You can’t miss it.

Told the ghost gang that the authorities are sending me back to India and will get the visa from there to merge the timelines. lol. So, I had the visa, but the tickets were few and expensive.

 

Anna went on a trek with Artem, but tried to keep it a secret. That’s fine, not a big deal. I went out with couple of people, nothing happened. When you have a connection with someone, there’s an unsaid faith even if its not showing on the surface.

Overall, she seemed sad. I was concerned. She was waiting, still wearing the astronaut. Still blocked on WhatsApp.

I also posted another medium essay in the way she writes infused with my own style to refute some wrong narrative. But, there was more wrong narrative based on that.

I had been talking to Natalie a lot about all this. Just to make understand that firstly, i am not violent, the whole narrative is wrong. It’s coming from some compilation of Anna’s insecurity, and the twisted mind of Charu. I sent the essay to her as well, so, there’s no way it doesn’t reach Anna. Then, I had to block her again because she was being weird about the whole thing. As if this was about her! When it had nothing to do with her or about any of these people in the middle. 

Natalie didn’t have that problem. In fact, I over shared with her. She being an English teacher, also knew some people in Tver. It was apparent she had made contact with Anna when she posted this photo based on some comment I made to Natalie only—>

Didn’t want to repeat past mistakes. So, instead of travelling to Tver, I spent the night at same hotel at the station itself, to get proper sleep, and travel fresh in the morning.

I was still a little afraid because of her posts, and the last message. Why not just have clean and proper communication? I appreciate that you feel a certain way about this scenario. But these are tough times. So much is going on in the world, its not easy to make these trips.

I called her upon reaching Tver, and she was angry from the onset. Refused to meet. Called me “Delusional” ala Pamela. After initial conversation, disconnected the call. Are you in touch with that toxic idiot, and delusional Pamela Weg?! Why? 

Can you time travel, and read these essays to save us all this trouble?

Called Chikee in frustration, saying that I have made this difficult journey, but she’s still acting entitled. Like i mentioned before, he was on a different tangent. Him, Shakey, and Frank had made some plan to botch this thing. Reading between the lines, Chikee’s desperation to convince me to leave Tver, among other things, gave it away. He probably didn’t know who’s daddy. I didn’t know how much fake info Anna had already. At the same time, she liked being the dominant partner, to have an edge, maybe it feels secure that way.

This is all i wanted to share the truth, when there are a ton of people spreading fake information. I thought she should have confidence in the person making all this effort for her rather than in idiots like Shakey and Chikee or Charu or whoever. I could have gone to her house, but what effort was she making? It didn’t feel right.

Told Chikee that I am texting Aditi, and we are going to hook up. He knew Aditi Rao Hydari’s number is in my contacts, so he thought that’s whats happening, initially. lol.

I blocked Chikee and everyone else, other than Natalie.

“Look at yourself” said Natalie when I shared photo of the second drink. lol. I was in total control. It was a bit of melodrama to get the word out there to Anna. 

It was raining outside. Again, have you felt Dejavu about a place? That’s how I felt about this place including this bar. Not particularly about the situation, but about the place itself. The little bridge I just crossed. The rain. About everything. Strange.

I could have handled the call differently as well. Could not have called Chikee. Taken my time. In hindsight. But, in real-time, i was just thinking she’s completely non empathetic. I have already made a significant effort. Least she can do is meet, so i don’t have to write these essays 3 years later 🤣.  I was in touch with Natalie, she asked me to let it go. I went to a bar.

But the fake narrative of me being violent or aggressive was still being played. If i was any such things then I would have reached her house, and made a scene. I didn’t. Also, I didn’t hurt anyone. Just some talk on the phone about how I was feeling, along with some assertiveness. I am the one who spent the money, made this effort, and you all are being judgemental + entitled?!

I was still staying a lemon loft hotel, little flirting with the owner. Nothing harmful, just light fun. She was married, anyway. My return flight was already booked. Didn’t seem like going to Moscow was the right thing to do. I was just going to wait in Tver, to see if Anna responds. Sure, it’s ridiculous, but what to do? Didn’t have free flow of money either. Only enough to survive for a week.

Spent rest of the time trying to run into Anna, somewhere. Once, i tried visiting her house with flowers, but it felt like someone is forcing me, rather than dong it out of love—> would rather wait for her text or call or run in, turned the cab around from in front of her house.

Much time was spent like this. Took lot more photographs this time around. There was one post from Anna, about our relationship not going well. Hmmm…

Amy from the construction company gave me some personal work during this trip to do online, which helped with the expenses.

Frank messaged me from his other number when I was boarding the flight to India. He didn’t know that, or anyone else. I am sure his intentions were good, I appreciated the checkin, and help, but like always him totally disregarding my awareness + intelligence was not cool. He was texting me from his USA number, because I blocked his india number, but he wasn’t ready to admit this basic FACT! Why?!

If you are getting caught multiple times, but keep doing the same thing, then it’s probably time to stop doing that thing, and speak clearly. What are you trying to achieve by ghosting beyond a point? All these people kept ignoring this basic understanding.

Star Signs—>

I had been in touch with Alexey from MA in Producing, even before making the first trip. He liked to play a saviour, told him that I have become a drunk Casanova as a joke, and that it’s all my fault. But, of course he took it seriously. He was very judgemental about the whole thing. Hello? When did I visit Russia or another country with a marriage proposal? Anna was even expecting it. 

It felt like I owed him few meals, so that’s why I really got in touch with him, to buy him a meal at the Iskcon in Moscow. But when he didn’t show any interest in joining, i went on my own for a meal during the first trip. It was a bit different from London, but still satisfying. The vibe was a little strange. When you are trying to play saviour, but other person does not want to be “saved”, one could feel betrayed. He had some bad experience with another Indian person, so are you going to label all of us? Other than meals which he himself offered, i never took any advantage of him, for him to not even meet when I am in Moscow was a bit rude. 

He did introduced me to one of his Astrologer friends on telegram, based in Vladivostok—> it’s a city in Russia, near the borders of China and North Korea. That’s funny, i thought. We are getting people from every corner of the world involved in this thing when myself and Anna could sort this out with a kiss 😘. 

I have known astrologers my whole life. Like mentioned before, it fine for those who practice, though its not an actual science. This guy was not going to tell me anything I didn’t already knew. So, much of my energy was being wasted in trying to stay safe from Covid, other than gathering all this information to make sense of my love life, it felt like a drag to let anyone take the left over bits. I liked Alexey, he was only naively narcissist, didn’t want to break his bubble. The idea has never been to impose my smartness on others, but let them be themselves.

SPACE, the final frontier—>

I had been researching about the Space tech domain, all over the world. Wrote to anyone I was connected to in this industry to make a fresh start, and did not find much enthusiasm. Well, i figured its less like Space Odyssey 2001, and more like FedEx on “flying unicorns.” You gotta give credit to Elon for making SpaceX both sound like a Sci-fi story, and function like the best transport company on earth. Space tech is pretty much transport, and parcel business in its current form. I had little credibility on the hard engineering side, no money to just dive in with ideas like Elon, and some other rich folks like Richard Branson or Jeff Bezos.

One of my ideas was to get into a space tech company to learn as much as I could during the pandemic, while getting paid. Like i said, wrote to a lot of people, but only one person replied from from Dhruva Space, an Indian space tech company based in Hyderabad—> he was kind to give me his time, and help get a better understanding of the industry in India. But, his advice for me to get into it was as a media guy like Gareeb Scientist, he does really good work, like many other immensely talented content people in this domain. Though, i have never been a content guy. Got into films because of curiosity in art, people and consciousness, other than technical understanding through VFX. 

There are idiots like Ruchir Joshi who think of themselves as chefs when only producing content for the food channel. At the same time, we are all content creators in the age of social media, either based on a business model, talent, skills or whatever. Did fiddled with the idea a bit, but it didn’t feel right. I wanted to build space ships, and making content about that process is fine. Everyone has their own ways.

Started exploring the technical side of another domain I had been following, and indulging with for a long time. It seemed relatable as a way of logic. Still, a bit reluctant, not diving deep enough, and wanting to make Hex, the animated film. As significant work had been put into it already, and it was only about packaging it properly. Anyway, there’s always a start to everything.

Pride and Prejudice—>

Didn’t had the time to spend in Moscow while returning from Tver, it was touch, and go to the airport. Both of these flights to a from were difficult in terms of following extreme Covid precautions, i had 2 x masks on, hand sanitiser always handy if i touch anything including my own face or masks. Hyper awareness is not easy, but is tiring. Home quarantined upon return. 

The ghost gang was probably still expecting me to be in Tver and Moscow. I had discovered insta stories through Anna, knew it was a thing, of course. But, her creative use of it really inspired me, well everything she does inspires me. Had not used it much, but now its storytelling potential felt fascinating. A now, I had no lans of going back to Tver, neither did I had any money left. But, in fact a small debt from putting the tickets to pay later which was being taken care of automatically from the wages, though it means less money to spend on daily expenses, and nothing to save. Pressure. 

I felt like she had been really careless with my time, and love. Not blaming her, it was all my decision, but still. So, i was going to have some more fun with her and the ghost gang using insta stories.

Before that, everyone from Urbanpod and Ashwin knew about something sketchy happening. I told Ashwin to say anything stupid about Anna, he said she was like “Kangana Ranaut.” So? What’s wrong with Kangana? Also, how does he know this? Then he was defensive. Unnecessary drama, rather than just admitting the truth. I responded by some drama of my own, like I am in the Pacific Ocean, and going to take a dive. Sent a gif to Sachin on WhatsApp with the same message—>

![IMG_0509.webp](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20edecee6139204ea59cef3af7572051f8/IMG_0509.webp)

Switched off Whatsapp. If you really knew me then you know that I won’t do anything like that but sadly no one really knew me. Also, how would I go to the Pacific Ocean?! lol. Even if I had money, you still need visa and transport. It being Covid times, nothing was that easy. I was dealing with people who would believe just whatever.

Anna made some Instagram posts to say this was just a prank, and she’s waiting for me. It was followed by some other posts. I also made some posts on my spare Instagram account to play along. The whole thing didn’t make much sense, if only we could have spoken to each other using one of the modern tools of direct communication.

Don’t think she had the right information, and might be thinking that I came all the way there to fool her which was not the case at all or whatever was going on in her head. This was her attempt to fool me. I sent her a text about the photo with astronauts locket, and she blocked me on Instagram. 

I changed my WhatsApp profile photo for the ghost gang to this—>

I was getting into a bit of depression. Could feel it in the heaviness of my eyes.

Akash Rana of Sixd called me when I posted the lion DP. I thought at least he’s not an idiot like the rest of the ghost gang. Sure, he was not a brightest, but personally I respected him as a friend. The only problem being that his access to Anna was through Charu, who as we have established is a “know it all” idiot, still better than going through Shakey. 

I visited Akash at his office when Covid restrictions were still at peak. This was important, I couldn’t stand Anna being this cynic about love. We spoke about it generally as Akash won’t admit to knowing anything. I also wanted to clear the narrative about me being called violent. What violent thing did I do? Who started this fake narrative? 

Based on previous experience, anytime we would speak about business, I would ask Akash to write a plan because he used to say yes to anything, then later discuss it with Pawan, and make a U turn. It’s not saying they are bad people. It’s the patterns people get into, and not seeing themselves objectively. Pawan had low self esteem, he would feel bad anytime you disagreed with him on anything, unless you made him realise it himself or made him look bigger—> I just didn’t have so much time.

The conversation with Akash did not lead to Anna unblocking me. She was going on a holiday. She had already been on few trips. She’s an individual, and free to make her own choices. At the same time, I again felt like the one making all the efforts, because I could have taken a holiday rather than going to Tver for her. I thought if she could go anywhere then why not come to me? But even when I go there, she was not thinking empathetically, and those trips were not like holidays for me. I did communicate this to Natalie, Akash and Surbhi. This sounded like a complain, but it was honest expression of how I felt. 

She was still on this trip, her birthday was coming up. I was still stuck in Covid with little money, not being able to communicate with her, other than insta stories. After one of the conversations with Surbhi or Akash, she posted this as a gesture of love—>

So, I couldn’t say anything now. Look, how cute she is 🥰. Her birthday was around the corner. I was still mad because I wanted to be with her, it’s not co dependence, but love. First, I was going to send her this photo as a passive aggressive present—>

Anna’s Vietnamese restaurant.

She got to know about it, but was not back by then. So, I asked the cafe to consume the cake, and wish happy birthday to Anna 🥳.

She was back in Tver, and i played a little prank of my own by posting the following insta stories to make it look like I am visiting again—>

She took it lightly, for a change.

She posted strange cryptic messages in response.

Anyway, this type of communication continued.

 

I asked Akash to come clean, he said that he does not lie. Well, okay?! No one who does not lie, actually says that.

Show me the money—>

I was trying everything I could in that limited mode of Covid restrictions to generate extra revenue. There were mid to long term projects, but also some short term endeavour like applying for an Epic Games Grant as development funding for Hex. 

Ashwin was again being a naysayer, rather than making an extra effort. But we received communication from Epic Games, they asked for additional details. It’s already mentioned in earlier essays about how Culture Machine and Ruchir botched the Mixed Reality project I had initiated with them and Epic Games, who own Unreal Engine. That was likely to come up if they dig deeper. But, were they told the truth or manufactured lies? 

Anyway, we were not prepared with a proper plan either without any money to show them actual on going development for the film using unreal engine. We put a plan together involving 3rd party studios building with unreal engine on paper to convince Epic—> but, usually these things work when you are building in the flow as there’s no actual RnD required for this stuff. Test are different from RnD, as tests are something thats already possible with the available tools, whilst RnD is about building new tools. But you wanna see tangible results by stretching the limits. 

We needed a setup, didn’t have it, my laptop was not equipped to run unreal engine. Not many 3rd party studios accessible to us were doing the kind of work we needed for this film either.  Also, I was not at a place to leave writing completely, and dive into technical side till there were funds to leave the construction job. It was all too much to juggle around in its current form.

Continued looking for investors that would suit our current situation, obviously there was friction of it being a film project, rather than a tech venture. Tried to persuade Ashwin to setup a separate company, he seemed ready, though we never got to it. 

All this time I was swelling upto the idea of a Metaverse based business model, though Ashwin was not very interested in that.
