- DISCLAIMERS
    
    I am aligned with humanity and everything non fiction is written from that perspective by default. Then, it's mentioned when other layers are added on top. 
    
    Nothing in this document is written for any specific individual or organization/ institution or government, therefore, no one should take unnecessary offence.
    
    If I wanted to address anything specific than specific examples would have been given alongside with evidence to make a proper point with responsibility.
    
    This has nothing to do with any Geo Political Issues whatsoever.
    
    Any colours mentioned below have nothing to do with any issues or ideology or politics and do not represent anything other than that colour itself.
    
    This is not a criticism piece but a think piece like it says in the title. If you don’t want to think than you can’t learn and therefore, not improve.
    
    Content or depicted events in this piece have nothing conscious or unconscious to do with my personal or relationships or professional life.
    

There's one 🍎 on a table in a room with two people—>

If we ask either of them about the amount of apples on this table, the answer is 1 apple. There is no room for misinterpretation.

If we ask either of them to describe the taste of this apple to them, the answer could have variations which are not precise or exactly the same or might be similar.

If we ask either of them about the amount of their individual appetite consuming that one apple has fulfilled, the answer could vary based on the individual.

If we asked either of them about the dishes they would like to make with that one apple, the answer could vary based on the individual.

👆 Information itself is not an absolute answer but is relative to the question and context of its subject.

In most cases, it's difficult to even know the exact information like how many apples are on the table? Thus, questions and contexts are left to our determination of the available information and not based on facts. To say, there's a gap in everything, that's how the light or darkness gets inside.

If we look at all information as a feature or a bug then lack of absoluteness could be looked upon as either, based on the conveyor and conveyed rather than being "bad" by default—> even though it's not a politically right thing to say. A feature is something useful right away while a bug is also a feature that needs fixing to be useful—> if you are aware, working on a solution and have time relative to the debugging compute? On the other hand, hiding or being unaware about bugs or its effects could be detrimental and there are plenty of examples in every domain to prove this claim, particularly finance. Bugs have many types, they can also be designed and never fixed—> go figure as homework 😉

What am I getting at with all this 👆?

You see the ladder icon—> its not a depiction of life but only a phase if you chose to look at life that way, based on the information in hand and not realising its lack of absoluteness. It could also be an escalator, elevator, helicopter, airplane, rocket, ground itself or maybe a cloud 🤷‍♂️. All of these devices are used to get somewhere, we are not meant to stay on them which makes being on top of the ladder a pretty stupid desire.

Climate is an important issue because even if we accelerate to humanity's future as a space exploring race at the speed of nuts, Earth will always be home, our default ship in this Cosmic Ocean, something to fall back on and its vital to make sure it forever remains in pristine condition.

Taking reference from my previous essay 'The Deal Makers'—> we had a regular deal with the natural world for most of history but that's been changing and a lot of things with that because of the interconnectedness of everything to everything else. Climate change is not something that can be tackled on its own—> it's like playing Cricket + Football + Baseball on a field at the same time with the same ball between multiple teams, its not at all a problem as long as the pre and post press conferences go well! Let's also add Rugby and MMA into the mix, not enough of a mess, is it? Just make sure, play by play is dramatic enough! 🤩

Most of the conferences around the world seem like the politicians were jealous of the movies and sports celebrities + wanting to seem as relevant as the scientists so they made their own leagues. "We just made this country give 1 billion to fight mars attack after back n forth for 2 days around the pool and it's a home run! Yay! We are so tired because of seamless room service with the biggest buffet in the universe but on to another conference for the people!" I don't know when we will get back to calling things for what they are…..Maybe that's a topic for another day. Don't come at me for saying the obvious, keep doing your thing.

It's common knowledge that no one can instantly turn a switch from using current fuels to completely environmentally friendly practices, this needs a gradual shift. Though we can empower the poorest in the world, what is stopping that? The argument that poverty or standards of living are not directly related to climate change stems from a lack of understanding of both and are a direct consequence of depleting empathy in the world.

We are drifting away from the point though, this is not a lecture or a pitch for a better future—> it's about generation and useful projection of information, it's about that single piece of fruit on the table with two people waiting to eat.

No need to put your wine glass down 🍷 🤗 …..Conferences are fine, fore play and the fun is legit. I get it, big announcements need a platform and everyone likes a bit of fan fare, we are all human after all, far from task to task perfectionists 🤢 which anyway sounds boring. However**,** that's a whole lot of billions which is a lot of information and in everyone's interest it's all spent well with factual input < — > output without any gapping black holes in between.

My instant solution for this would be an end to end and open source system to keep track of not just the money but also the promises even if such a system comes at the cost of a couple of conference budgets. Doesn't seem like the most difficult though definitely complicated and will take one thing off my plate 🤠

Why open source? Because centrality won't work in this case as every country and organisation would want inter connected but sovereign access. The information and the money is not proprietary to any one person even if they put efforts into securing the deal as part of the agenda they are representing and humanity as a whole. Just saying THIS is actionable does not make it actionable unless we actually "make it so." 🛸

*This is not a criticism of #COP28UAE or conferences but a general think piece about the need for actionable and trackable movement of funds in addition to all other earnest efforts.
