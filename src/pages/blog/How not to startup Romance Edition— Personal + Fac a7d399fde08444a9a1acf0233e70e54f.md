Finally, the day arrived. I made my way to the Airport. There was a little hiccup at the airport when the dummy ticket was not accepted at first. I had to call the travel agent to get a latest dummy ticket which was accepted. This also happened—>

The emoji is wrong, the tweet is passive aggressive, not angry. Just wanted to note that this happened.

Anyone met Modi ji? Just saying. Might as well, right? lol.

This also happened, again I was just tweeting everything for the record—>

Anna had posted this in the meanwhile, other Than a Sketch of a crow on its own in the city, which I can’t find right now. Me being the crow, obviously—>

This was posted by Anna when I reached Russia, and she posted an angry shark right when i boarded the plane.

I reached SVO airport at late evening. By the time I would have reached Tver, it would had been mid night or past mid night. Also, all I could see everywhere was snow. That’s why, I booked The Travellers’s In, next to the airport for the night. 

I had seen snow before in Shimla and London, but not this much snow. Wait for the video from the train window to Tver. 

Other than the snow, i was a bit bothered by Anna’s anger. She could have called me, and taken it out. But didn’t know what was waiting when I get there.

I arrived in Tver around early eveing. Went straight to Buna Buna cafe to have something to eat and finish some work for Ash. Also, Anna would know that I have arrived, as someone from the cafe would tell her. She had posted nothing positve from the moment i took the flight. It was -24 degress, and tempature forecast was similar for the remaining week.

![IMG_9090.png](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20a7d399fde08444a9a1acf0233e70e54f/IMG_9090.png)

Decided to first get a hotel, and then go meet her. Didn’t want to stay at Lemon Loft Hotel this time around. I looked up some hotels, and spent about 1 hour visiting couple of them. It was important to make sure, the hotel had good heating, last thing I wanted was to fall sick with all these complications. Also, it should be in down town. First couple of hotels did not have convincing heating or environment. There was a default, but slighly expensive option in The Gurbenator Hotel, and decided to take that in the end. As Amal, a nice duty manager at the front desk offered a slighly discounted rate. She was really kind.

She had posted this which made me think she’s mad about me making those drawings for Pamela after 1.5 years?! Nothing even happened. 

Why else are you posting this now. At the same time, i knew she was home, and not at the hotel with the deer head. I went looking for a wine bottle as well, but couldn’t find anything special.

Checked in. So, at least I have a place to hunker down. I thought, whatever the issue, we shall figure it out in couple of days. I called Anna that same evening from the hotel lobby, and she did not respond. The call connected, but she said nothing. It was a really quick call. Should I have called once more? I thought, she should return call, and lets see if she does.

![IMG_3904.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20a7d399fde08444a9a1acf0233e70e54f/IMG_3904.jpeg)

Decided to spend the night at the hotel. Spoke to Amal. She seemed to already know something about us. It’s a small town. She asked some personal questions about myself + Anna, and I was honest with her.

![6E5FA04F-4722-41E9-A9A1-09DC62CC4DC1.png](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20a7d399fde08444a9a1acf0233e70e54f/6E5FA04F-4722-41E9-A9A1-09DC62CC4DC1.png)

Next day, I was still waiting for Anna’s call till the afternoon. Spent time doing Ash’s work between Buna Buna and Gurbenator Hotel. Decided to make a move as the evening approached. I had to be covered from tow to head because of the cold temperature. This is the time I should have had a drink or two for staying warm, but didn’t. That didn’t even occurred to me. 

Got the flowers, Booked a Yandex, it’s going to her home. I am anxious, it’s a big deal. At the same time, I don’t have crazy expectations either. Thinking, hopefully it goes well! I called her directly, rather than WhatsApp while still in the cab as it approached her house. She had my number. 

She picked up the call, and asked “What do you want?” lol. 

“I want you.” I was too scared to say that. lol.

Told her I am outside of her house.

“I am coming outside” She said. 

Or call me inside? I thought. 

She came out. Locking the doors behind her. Offered her the flowers, she took them. 

A car was standing on the far end of the street, its head lights came on, right at that time. 

She said something about going out with someone else, i thought it’s a silly joke, and joked about it. I am freezing all this time. Why was the car not standing right in front of her house?

![45C9C136-50F7-4CA0-B948-9D0E3D2DC56B.png](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20a7d399fde08444a9a1acf0233e70e54f/45C9C136-50F7-4CA0-B948-9D0E3D2DC56B.png)

I tried to hug her, she said “Don’t touch me.” Woh woh woh! Alright. Once, you say that. I backed off.

She then repeated the same things, word for word as I had said in a light conversation about us, to the sister in law. I tried to tell her to not listen to her or those people upon hearing that. Tried to convince her to go for coffee, if not right now, then maybe tomorrow. 

But she was just angry. Like, she wanted to be angry. I was shivering with cold. Almost full moon was up in the night, I tried to “divert” conversation to that, maybe insert some aesthetics into this conversation. But she was having none of it. She placed the flowers on her house gate. 

Told her about it being 2 years since we met, for the first time on 9th December. 

“Why are you doing this?” I asked. She did don’t answer.

Just turned around, and started walking towards the car. 

She intentionally dropped her Monzo bank card on the ground. Don’t know what that was about? Had to take off my gloves to pick it up. My iPhone SE fell out from the front pocket on the ground. It stopped working.

“You dropped your card.” I shouted. 

She turned around, and said “What? What is it?”

“You have dropped your bank card.” I said, and gave it back to her along with the most disappointed look I have ever given anyone ever. As she walked back to the car at the end of the street.

“Don’t do this, it will be different.” I said as she was walking away. Said it few times.

I quickly took photo of the flowers placed on the gate, and of the moon from the iPhone X. It only had little battery left. The Russian mobile chip was inside the iPhone SE. I couldn’t call a cab. Didn’t have the pin handy. 

Started walking towards the end of the street, Anna was in the car, they reversed the car right as I crossed it. Didn’t look at them. To go hell, I thought.

Went inside the supermarket at the end of the street to find a power socket to charge the phone. My hands were completely frozen. Couldn’t afford to pull them out. Asked for help, but the people there did not even try to understand, they started accusing me of something in Russian language. I couldn’t understand them, but it was not safe to stay there. They were not going to help. 

I knew there a much bigger supermarket at the end of the main road, and decided to make a walk. What else could I have done? I was not angry, but really disappointed in everything. I did as promised, what else could I have done? Maybe, love is not a real thing. Chasing cars?

Didn’t feel depressed, but strange. Is this the end or the beginning? I thought. 

This big super market was about 4 to 5 kms away. Some part of me thought, this is going to be the end of me in the cold. lol. But I never give up. Kept walking. This was the last photo I took from the IPhone X before it went out of battery as well. It was just too beautiful! lol. Never give up. Never let despair keep you from seeing the beauty of the world. Posted this after getting back to the hotel.

[https://x.com/pathintegral0/status/1469602620700442626](https://x.com/pathintegral0/status/1469602620700442626)

The road was busy with several cars going up and down. I didn’t even have google translate now to explain myself for any help. Kept walking, kept walking. The big super market came up eventually. 

Went inside, approached the women staff standing in a group. Firstly, they thought I was being funny. Then one of them understood I wanted to charge my phone battery, and took me to a mobile repairing booth within the super market. The repairman was from Tajikistan as far as I remember. iPhone SE was not turning on. He opened it, and said the display has gone bad. I didn’t want to lose data by losing something in translation. Communication was not seamless because of the language. 

Inserted the tele2 Russian chip into the IPhoneX. Had it charge a bit at this shop. Paid something to him. Called a Yandex to the Gurbenator Hotel. If I could handle all this, still almost intact emotionally, then whats not possible? I thought. There’s always hope. 

From The Gurbenator Hotel—>

Came back to the hotel, but didn’t want to be alone. Therefore, i went to the hotel restaurant. They had some guests in celebratory mood, while I just couldn’t help crying. It was a natural reaction. Felt like it’s a lost cause. She does not believe or feel love. Lets say, you don’t believe in love, you could still talk or have a tea with someone you were expecting who had made this much effort for you in -24 degrees, rather than running a stunt. I was not even thinking about all this stuff at that time in the restaurant. A part of me wanted to join the Russian dance in that hall.

The waitresses at the restaurant were quite interested, like seriously I could have asked any of them out, but it just didn’t feel right. I had some meal that they recommended, and organised some of the things as I only had one phone now. I also had the Google Pixel, but its motherboard had a problem for couple of years, therefore, it became a spare phone. It would restart at anytime, had no sound among other issues.

Went for a walk, and came to this place.

Beauty can be found anywhere, and it helps in healing your heart. Click the YouTube link for full version.

The hotel room was wonderful, the best part was its heating. I could take off every piece of clothing, and sleep. But I was not going to give up. My story would not be sad. What wrong am I doing? I came all the way down here to full fill promise. If she’s being misguided by assholes than I can’t let my love lose because of this rubbish.

I bought some Twitter followers using a portion of the Bitcoin I had bought a coupe of weeks ago for INR 5000.00 only. lol. Thought, I was going to make most of this opportunity. Yes, everything is an opportunity, especially adversities.

It was hilarious because the followers would start disappearing only in about a week, as they were for limited time as per the service. They all the follower were like really shady. A fuckin scam.

Anna had posted this on that same night. How come you never posted a photo or video of you hugging someone at a party, but now? She was just trying to get back at me, and this was her way. Get back at me for what?! I thought, she was being stupid more than anything as she was not going to find a better life partner than myself. lol. 

I was posting these tweets from the hotel so she knows where i am staying, and comes running into my arms upon realising her mistake 🤷🏽‍♂️.

Then she posted video of snow boarding again for my attention. Why do you think, this is the way to make amends?! It’s just her conditioning. You are not competing with me, we are on the same team! kept thinking she if actually spent the whole year trying to “destroy me?” Like she had said in her WhatsApp message at the end of the first trip. Well, I didn’t feel like destroyed. It can’t be that. Still, the dynamics suck. Do you want to spend our lives competing with each other? Whose idea of relationship are you trying to emulate? Freedom does not mean you have to have power over me to the point of keeping me subjugated. Being in love means you have absolute power over me already, but it’s your prejudiced mindset that does not see beyond the conditioning.

I used to check in everyday, spent the day sitting at the space at the window, and then check in again. There was no immediate ticket, and going back like this felt ridiculous. At the same time, I was running out of money. If I had unlimited money, then I could have taken a band to her house or whatever, but such stunts were not an option.

[https://youtu.be/JlETP8_oMhU?si=yUCbrTBXpK16WgOL](https://youtu.be/JlETP8_oMhU?si=yUCbrTBXpK16WgOL)

There was a waitress at Buna Buna who was hitting at me, i flirt casually. Still, I was not going to sleep with anyone in Tver, because I didn’t want to hurt Anna. I love her, why would I try to hurt her?

She posted another insta story about being at a bar 5mins away from the hotel. I was sitting at the window seat in the lobby, knowing the receptionist was keeping an eye on me. Acted like I was going to go to the bar to beat up this dude with the car, fixed my gloves, and body language. Do you think I am crazy going into have a fight with a bunch of Russian in a bar, all alone or at all? I was just putting up a show. I am in the middle of nowhere, that’s the last thing I would do. lol. Kept walking around the bar, i knew exactly where it was, but common. Why are you even trying to put me in such situations? lol. She’s trying to be even, i love her for being real like that, but silly. 

[https://x.com/pathintegral0/status/1469724368905375749](https://x.com/pathintegral0/status/1469724368905375749)

I called mum, and told her to talk to sister in law, and correct the record. I was a bit aggressive in my tone, yes, because I was all the way there spending money and time, waiting my days in extreme cold. No one was taking any responsibility or accountability. If you want to involved then, have the courage to show some honesty. of course, they claimed to have no involvement. Whatever. Now, the word spread of me being aggressive. Excuse me? Asking to correct the record is aggressive, but putting me in this actual sick situation is not aggressive? Also, if you actually consider what I said then it doesn’t even make sense—> “I will send her whole family back to Bangladesh.” lol. Later, i thought about it, and it would be too time consuming, not worth it etc, even if possible. lol. It was just the thing to say in the moment. I was not going to waste my time on such low vibe things.

[https://x.com/pathintegral0/status/1470341417809580033](https://x.com/pathintegral0/status/1470341417809580033)

I knew Anna’s English speaking club meeting happened on particular days, and thought that would be a good place to propose to her. Because Ash, and the internet thought, I Should have proposed, rather than asking for a conversation. I am sorry. Again. I want to be clear and transparent before we accept each other. People sleep with each other before getting married, I am just asking for a conversation. But, maybe let’s do this, and then have a conversation. i thought. The light switches work the other way around in Russia, so if we are going by that logic. Fine.

I was moving around between few cafés in the city centre itself. It was not easiest to find healthy food with the language barriers. 

[https://x.com/pathintegral0/status/1470759782218878983](https://x.com/pathintegral0/status/1470759782218878983)

15th December, evening. It was also my bother’s birthday. I sent him an email. 

Had checked out of the Gurbenator hotel. I didn’t have enough money to get another hotel. So, that was another reason I wanted to talk to her. Along with being the primary factor in my apprehension to propose while I have no money, and you are not listening. 

[https://x.com/pathintegral0/status/1471182800199901184](https://x.com/pathintegral0/status/1471182800199901184)

I was really anxious before going into the cafe. Anna had posted that she was going to be at the English club. Got Ash on the phone to talk me through, it felt like a big decision. Kept pacing around the cafe’s and on the street for at least 45 mins, before I finally put together enough courage to propose in public. The staff knew me obviously. I called one of them to the gate after entering, and showed the ring, saying I am going to propose. They did not understand much.

But anyway, I powered through, and went towards the group to notice Anna was not there. They all knew me as well! Said Hello. Looking lost. Egor and Artem came to talk. Showed them the ring. Artem asked some stupid question that was totally awkward in the context. Egor told me that Anna might still come, a bit later. We shared phone numbers, messaged on telegram, and he assured of informing me about Anna’s arrival. 

I waited at another cafe nearby. This cafe also knew me, being the only romantic foreigner in town. Showed them the ring, and told them I was just waiting to propose to Anna. Anxiousness.

Kept waiting, texting Egor, to now about Anna’s arrival. It was around 12’o clock. He told me she’s not coming, and that “you should talk to her.” lol. Yeah, buddy. I don’t know what versions of things you have been told, but I have been trying to talk to her for a while. Hilarious.

From The Hotel Volga—>

I convinced Ash to send me some advance. Got back to the Gurbenator Hotel, they only had the most expensive room available now, and also seemed like they were reluctant to even rent the room.

[https://x.com/pathintegral0/status/1471018913685139456](https://x.com/pathintegral0/status/1471018913685139456)

That’s when I moved to The Hotel Volga, it was slightly cheaper with rectangular box sized room with single bed, and view of the frozen Volga river or back side, depending the room number. Clean. Heating was not as good as The Gurbenator Hotel, but not that bad either. I wanted to speak to someone, Natalie had not been in touch, everyone else was seemingly compromised. 

Sambhav, my friend from the Animation institute days was liking my insta stories, so I called him up. We’re speaking after a long time. He seemed to know a lot already. Insta stories? More? We spoke about this thing in detail, he’s a good listener. It felt better after speaking to him.

We spoke again next day, and he was quite persuasive in convincing me to propose, since that’s what I went there to do, but I was more convinced by reading between the lines. I was trying to protect her by not telling everything to everyone. It’s never one person’s fault, anyway.

This hotel was right next to the Irish bar we went for dinner with the English Speaking Club, the first time around. It was right in the middle of the downtown. A perfect location to set a complicated romantic comedy in Tver, Russia. They also had a river facing restaurant, like one of those small town American diners—> it served buffet whole day long in different varieties.

This helped with my food situation, a bit. I did meet an Indian man there! He was visiting from ‘Tata Consultancy Services’ for some work. Alright. There was a lot going on at this hotel. I was definitely under surveillance for some reason, as my room and luggage were scanned through, again while I used to take breakfast.

I was walking towards the Main Street from the Hotel one of these days, when noticed one of the waitress from LOVE COFFEE CAFE following me or just happened to be behind me for some reason. We were standing at the traffic light together. She was going towards the cafe of course, of course? We kept going the same way for a while, but I sharply made a turn to change ways as soon as I realised whats happening. Don’t know, whatever.

Only affordable flight available was at the end of the month. I was going to use a credit limit to book that, but suddenly it went to ‘0’ without notice. I had already taken advance for the expenses. It was getting tougher by the day.

The Overlook Hotel Look alike—>

Only after a day at the Hotel Volga, I had to change the hotel for a day again, because of running out of money. Had to do something for Ash to get the advance to move back into Hotel Volga next day. This is the story in tweets of this weird and cheaper version of The Overlook Hotel from The Shinning by Stanley Kubrick based on a novel by Stephen King, but this one had the Russian version of Meryl Street at the reception—>

Back From The Hotel Volga—>

I used to often visit The TAUN, the restaurant where Anna and I had the argument first time around. It used to be open till late at night, had good food as well. Anna’s friends used to be there, they would take my photos. One of the waitress there was flirting with me, I responded just for fun, then the bar tender asked her to stop. Well. 

![That axe image is just for fun, to say that I was in trouble, and didn’t mean anything bad.

Based on the conversation with Egor’s, I again tried to talk to Anna.

I buckled up, booked a cab to her house. Called her on the way, she picked up. She said “I am not going to come anywhere.” 

And, also added “You don’t need to go anywhere either.” 

Why give confusing statements?! I thought.

She kept saying there’s nothing to say. 

I kept asking to meet to talk. But she just won’t listen, and disconnected the call. 

Asked the cab driver to turn it back to the hotel.

I went down for a walk after the fire works.

Proceeded by a morning of hope—>

The frozen River, and the phone—>

I went for a drink, mind you I have not had a drink on this trip till now. Told Sambhav that I was going for a walk on the frozen Volga river because one of it channel runs past Anna’s house. I was not going to do that. But, I did walked upto it, and went a little further than usual. Bent down to tie my shoes, when the iPhone X fell into soft snowy water from the front pocket of my jacket, I didn’t realise this till I reached the hotel restaurant. It was really late, the waitress tries to call the phone number, it was switched off. This was my only working phone. This was not at the dinner, but another fine dinning restaurant at the hotel.

I ran back to the river, it was cold, snow falling. There were couple of people right at the spot from where you walk down the steps to the river, and they spoke perfect English. I asked them about, but they had not seen anything. I slid down the snowy steps, looking frantically for the phone. 

Think I saw Olya, and her family at the round about, on the way back to the hotel. She’s Anna’s friend. 

[https://x.com/pathintegral0/status/1472671091940216832](https://x.com/pathintegral0/status/1472671091940216832)

It’s all for love—>

Both Sambhav and Ash kept asking about my plans for proposing to Anna. They convinced me to just go for it. 

I was going to leave for her house in the early evening. Went to Buna Buna Cafe, and the song “Dream a Little Dream” By Mamas and the Papas started playing as soon as I took a seat.

Bought a wine bottle from a nice little wine shop. Got the flower from a shop nearby to the hotel. There were couple of women floweriest, and they liked the ring. One of them was named Anna. They also appreciated the effort I was making. 

I booked a Yandex again, on the way to her house. Sambhav was online for much of the way. I called her from the end of the street. We were on the other end of the street from the one i usually take because of change in route due to the location of the hotel. Her house was much farther away. But my number was blocked! Sorry. Red flag. I am not going to propose till my number is unblocked. It’s again -24 degrees after a week of relief when the temp was within -1 and -10 degrees. I was not going to stand in the cold, not going to ring the bell, we needed to bring some civility, and sensibility into this discourse.

Asked the cab driver to take me back. He refused, saying he has another pick up, and insisted that I get down. Phone’s battery used to drain out as soon as I left the hotel, apparently iPhone batteries don’t do well in extreme cold, and need a special casing.

He literally dropped me in the middle of no where with a dying phone, a flower bouquet and a wine bottle in hands with gloves that were not the best for this temperature. Tried booking another cab, but the phone battery completely ran out right after speaking to the driver. I knew about a gas station 1 Km away, and decided to make the walk when booking another cab was no longer an option. It felt like my hands were being put in between 1000’s of small burning pins, getting completely frosted. It was extremely painful to hold the wine bottle and the flowers at the same time with frost cutting into my hands, while walking to the gas station, but they were expensive, i was not going to just leave the items!

My feet started feeling a bit of the same pain as well, but it was nothing compared to the hands. It’s was dark with light snowfall, everything at the same time, like a character in an apocalyptic movie. Somehow, I made it to the gas station. 

It took almost half n hour to get my hands back to normal. They had power sockets, and everything. I also bought a hot tea. Had Sambhav on the call again. Tried explaining this situation using another situation from my childhood as an analogy. You gotta know yourself. Adversity makes me better, it helps to know myself slightly more, but I want to meet her without confusion or any power play. I am happy to keep showing up, but she needed to break this Great Dubious Wall of Anna. It’s unconditional love, it’s forever, she could become a mafia don, and I would keep lovin her, but we needed to look in the eye.

Sambhav kept saying that I should have gone to the house. Well, he did not know all the things. But based on his confidence, and my love for her, i made another attempt in the morning. 

This time I had a woman cab driver, she parked the car in front of her house, and came out to look as I approached her front door. I rang the door bell, knocked the door, shouted little bit, but she did not open the door. The curtain on the 1st floor window was undone, and I could see the star.

I left the flowers there, but did not leave the wine bottle. I was pissed. You can’t keep doing this. It’s mindless craziness. I can’t keep doing this. Went back to the hotel, gave the wine bottle to the waitress at the diner as a thank you for being kind.

I was not going to stay there if not for Anna, did not even know if she was at home anymore or gone somewhere. Even if, this was just point less. Why?! There was nothing to get even about. I was delayed because of genuine reasons, and she would not even take a call or anything. I tried to understand things from her perspective, but at some point you gotta stop doing that. Took the next available train to Moscow. Now the rumour me having someone in Moscow again surfaced. lol. I had a conversation with Ash, and he said that I should have stayed in Tver. At the same time, he warned he that Russia could attack Ukraine anytime, and maybe I should leave as a soon as possible. Hmmm what?! That’s the first time I was hearing about it. 

![0F67AB55-50B1-49B2-BAF6-37340BD590E1.png](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Romance%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20a7d399fde08444a9a1acf0233e70e54f/0F67AB55-50B1-49B2-BAF6-37340BD590E1.png)

The thing is, I would always come back for Anna. I love her. This was all just silliness, which had turned toxic. She just wanted to look good, and defend her insecurities, cold feet etc rather than have a genuine conversation. She was more concerned about her “image” rather than our relationship.

Then Ash said something that I had only told my mum about probably staying at his place for a few months whilst he’s in Spain, to settle in, upon getting a proper working visa. That was no longer an option, unless he was going to invest some money into my company for an entrepreneurial visa to the UK. Anna’s friend Galina, Olya and Olya’s husband Deevipe had also posted related stories. I was not going to come here again for this, why have any regrets? 

I was going to stay the night at the Leningardsky Station itself, but they said it was going to close at 1am. Stayed the night at Kraski Leta, the Urbanpod of Moscow, and then took an afternoon train to Tver. 

[https://youtu.be/T5xhs883_SI?si=Nw46hrAv7RBiGwE8](https://youtu.be/T5xhs883_SI?si=Nw46hrAv7RBiGwE8)

As we approached Tver station, first time I heard about Tver’s true speciality after all these visits from the train announcement—> “City of Military Glory.” Anyway.

Got another flower bouquet, the girl at the flower shop whose name was also Anna said “There are many Anna’s here.” lol. For sure. She was cute. Haha. I was ready to get another cab, but Ash gave me some urgent work, and insisted that I complete it right then. I had to get the room at Hotel Volga again for a night. There was a duty attendant at the hotel reception who was also showing a lot of interest in my activities. Apparently, all girls wanted to leave this town. lol. Sambhav was also in touch, he asked me get him a Russian doll. The hotel has a souvenir shop right next to the lobby selling Russian dolls, i had not told him about it. Anyway. 

I went to her house again in the morning. Rang the door bell. Knocked on the door. Spent about half n hour standing outside, walking on her street. Multiple neighbours were outside doing something, but she either was not home or did not respond. Came back to the hotel. There was an attempted hack on my IPhone X. It flickered, and puff, had to reinstall from factory settings.

Couldn’t have done anything. I was even more pissed. This was really toxic. Spent as much time at the hotel lobby as I could. Sambhav and Ash also recommended to leave. I booked a cab to the train station in the evening, taking a detour via her house. I just had to leave the flowers there. Sambhav was really scared, kept telling me to just leave. I had to leave the flowers. Just because I don’t like getting into unnecessary physical alterations, does not mean I am scared of anyone at all. I mean anyone at all. Mostly, I avoid stupidness because I have better things to do. Every conflict can be solved with peaceful conversations.

I kept the flowers in the snow, in her front yard, and made my way to the train station in the same cab. I was talking to Sambhav, but a funny dude at the waiting area was listening to everything’s. Sambhav tried to insinuate that it’s not her fault, and maybe it’s my expectation. Now you have the details that you didn’t have then. I had to block him, he blocked me in turn as well—> I know that because I unblocked him in a few hours.

Back in Moscow, I had a day before taking the flight back to Delhi. Like I said, the credit limit was gone suddenly, Ash refused to give anymore advance. I had to ask for help from parents for the ticket only. In fact, in the morning Ash asked me for the accounts which I gave him exactly to the last penny. He had only given me one months salary in  advance, that too in several tranches in the past weeks, one week I had no money, therefore, couldn’t even think about proposing or anything. Considering the situation, and that I had been working for this company from the start, for 9 years, deserved a little better.

Spent the day at my favourite cafe at Leningardsky Station. On my way to the Airport, an Asian looking women from Kazakistan came right beside, asked for directions to a metro platform. Said that she’s an epidemiologist. Okay? We were headed the same way. In the metro, “Would you teach me some English” she asked. “I have to catch an Airplane” I replied. We exchanged telegram, but I never texted her after that day. Got down at the next station to catch the train.

While waiting for the train to SVO, i met a Russian ballet dance judge. Again, i was trying to protect her, and maybe also my ego. Couldn’t tell him everything. Said she’s bothered by my anger, which as we know is not the case.

[https://x.com/pathintegral0/status/1474852936886853633](https://x.com/pathintegral0/status/1474852936886853633)

Ash told me that Bayer stole all of his toolkits, and moved back to Mongolia. He was going to register a police complaint. Tried to help him track Bayer, a bit. It was like the South Korean movie Parasite. Of course, Bayer was not happy. Felt like end of an era. 

I had started preparing to pivot to tech completely. Things could have been really different with proper money. Felt untethered without Anna to concentrate on writing screenplays, to say the least.

Rest of the journey was pretty much uneventful, other than random things like a guy asking me to take his package through customs, of course, I refused bluntly. There was a really talkative girl sitting right next to me on the flight, kept telling her story, while trying to relate it to mine. Apparently, her uncle, married to a Russian women was sitting on the other side of the aisle. 

The family was in Vrindavan, at recitation of Bhagwat Gita. I had already read the Gita, other than visually remembering every details of the Mahabharta, and Ramanyan from the television shows. Didn’t want to be around anyone. Had no money. Sold the iPhone X at Nehru Place, and got the IPhone SE fixed. Moved to Bloom Hotel near Jangpura because it was most affordable, good location and clean. 

[https://x.com/pathintegral0/status/1476307530699661315](https://x.com/pathintegral0/status/1476307530699661315)

Spent few days at the bloom hotel, till the new year, and moved back to the house as it was empty now. 

Still had the job, but not for too long. I tried negotiating some advance with Ash, but he instead fired me without any warning or notice or severance after working together for so long. Couple of days after, he asked me to do something, while ignoring the issue. 

I was not going to get anywhere with this job. Applied for few other jobs, and thought its only a matter of time. Made up with Ash since then, we are fine. Rest as they say, is history.

Couldn’t find the ring when I got to the hotel room in Delhi, i thought thats poetic justice. But then it just fell out from the pocket of my jacket, poetic justice indeed. Maybe, love is never lost. Hope.

#A woman started showing up at Starbucks, Nehru Place before my 4th trip to Russia. Never spoke to her during that time, but would often spot her, even when I was seated at Lopera Cafe.

When I came back from the 4th Russian trip, she was at the Starbucks, Nehru Place. She used to always give me a look, not subtle or vague. Didn’t speak to her at first. Then she also started showing up at Starbucks, Khan Market. It turns out that she used to work at Starbucks, auditing the spaces for quality or something like that. I was already in love with Anna, there was no chance of a relationship. But you can always make friends. Though, only in our initial conversation she told me about being resident in C R Park, and that her name is Sharmistha. It was a non starter for a friendship, as well. I was totally not interested. 

#Anyone who had read all of my essays or just seen my LinkedIn profile knows that’s I wrote an unproduced screenplay titled Civil War. The lead character in that series was last named ‘Pal’ based on the Fiat car’s that used to have a ‘Pal’ logo at the front bonnet. My father’s first car was a Fiat, he used to love them. Before writing a draft of this screenplay, I spotted an old Fiat car while wandering around South Bombay. The character was a taxi driver, and most taxi’s in Bombay were Fiat cars, till not that long ago—> So, it was also a tribute. But my brother’s wifes name is also ‘Sharmistha Pal.’ And, she’s also from C R Park. What are the coincidences?! lol. Jokes aside, she’s a certain kind of narcissist who refuses to acknowledge or work on herself. 

Added 29/07/2024—> few weeks went past, i was applying for job to have some money as a way to buy time to work on the personal project I was working on. Anna was posting stuff. Family was denying knowing about Anna, when on plenty on occasions they said things they weren’t supposed to know, unless they were involved. Anyway, I had a cry one night when some unwanted comments were being made. Rajat said “call that girl” seeing me like that, but Sharmistha Pal told him not to, and started blaming me. I told her to please not talk to me. On 14th Feb morning, Sharmistha was shouting at my mother, i took mom away, Sharmistha said something directed at me, i told her “mind your business.” Not shouted. Completely normally. She on the other hand, just went off like I have never seen anyone go off before, not even Deepak from London house. Like a volcano waiting to vent out, on the top of her voice, she started shouting at me, saying I am the this and that, all the nerves on her face bursting and boiling, i again had a smile on my face. lol. She kept going. I asked mum to calm her down. It was totally unwarranted. 

I started packing my stuff to leave, not knowing how to deal with such behaviour. Well, didn’t have any money or a job at that point, so I wanted to leave, but what was i gonna do?! Everyone was so serious. I asked Sharmistha, how would she feel if i shouted at her parents every now and then? She gave a really low energy answer, that I don’t want to even mention, but I never wanted to speak or to do anything with this person from that point onwards. Nothing is going to change my mind in this regard.

I used to leave every morning to work out of a cafe as a change of environment, to not be caught up in the low energy surroundings. I did want to go away somewhere, but couldn’t have, and was going to be back in the evening. My father said “you don’t even have any money” and Rajat started shouting at me, said something about my finances as well. He owed me money, and could have returned. Anyway. I was in this situation first time in about 9 years—> first time in 16 years taking help from parents for expenses, and they were not admitting knowing about the issue. So, I created an anomaly by saying “you think I don’t have any money? All I have to do is sell one bitcoin.” Aah, suddenly, it seemed like I said something they wanted to hear. I only had the bitcoin bought in December for rupees 5000. lol. 

I remember my father once smashing our own Maruti Suzuki 800 into our own Fiat while reversing the car, on his own birthday. lol. We were in the Maruti, but he just took us out for dinner like nothing happened, it was a little tense, for sure 😆. I think he was drunk that night as he kept shouting at random people in the traffic during the ride, we stopped to pick up my brother from his cyber cafe shop, and he was shouting at him as well. But, of course dad’s don’t admit all this, that’s not even the point. 

#Already wrote about Max at Starbucks, Khan Market. I used to say everything to him as an absurdist joke, thought he understood. But apparently he did not. As once, i joked about Anna having 10 of my kids, and being busy in raising them, but he took it extremely seriously, and accused of me being against women rights or something. Thats just crazy, this dude is nuts, I thought. It has to be our mutual decision to have kids or not or however many, how can anyone take that seriously? Did you took the thing seriously where I spoke about myself and Anna becoming king and queen of Russia?!

#One evening, Mr. Pawan Khera, a spokesperson of the Indian National Congress showed up at the Starbucks, Khan Market. This Max fella pointed him out to me, and said he’s a fan of Mr. Khera, and wanted to talk to him about joining the party. “What a strange fella? Who idolises spokespeople?” I thought. Anyway, who am I to judge?! Helped him with the approach, and it went fine. Though, I don’t know what happened afterwards? If he ever joined the party or not. Whatever.

#Someone named Ashish showed up at Starbucks, Khan Market after i came back from the 4th trip to Russia. Said he was building a utility platform for the UK market with a chat bot. I have a knack of speaking to the people who want to speak to me. He used to live in Thailand, but was from Delhi. Have lived in the UK. We spoke for a while, he made me a really sloppy offer which was worse than what I was getting from Ash. Like, are you serious?! While his own knowledge of things was levels below mine. Who’s figuring out whom, at the end of the day? lol.

#Restaurants/ cafés in Tver and the few places I visited in Moscow served food warmly. Other than Sandwiches or bakery products of different kind, limited vegetarian meals I often had there were tomato soup with a toast, spinach soup with toast, lentils soup. The buffet at Hotel Volga was interesting, though no one item comes to mind in particular. Supermarkets had fresh fruits and vegetables, other than usual variety of item like everywhere around the world.

#I slipped in the snow, and fell on my hips about 4 to 5 times in Tver. Hips seem fine otherwise, but I can’t sit on hard surfaces for lengthy times. My back was already not great.
