I used to stay in hotels mostly at this point. Whatever was within affordable prices but amazing budget was a big issue with permanent but limited income. Thought about investing but needed to increase the income first. Being able to travel and write was more important to achieve the goals. I was also giving some money to parents every month or paying some of their bills or both sometimes. Money management was crucial. 

Ash was getting old while not keeping good health so the permanent income could turn off anytime, as far as I was concerned. It was also stressful to manage the work that I didn‚Äôt enjoy much but was literally on call 24x7 with rest of the things going on. I was not particularly trying to hide that job but what‚Äôs the point of putting that on my resume or bio?! Sure, I learned a lot of things which is a different matter altogether like juggling it with creative work. It‚Äôs tough to constantly shift focus until you get good at it.

Staying in 2 to 3 star hotels was not too productive, because I would need to step out to a cafe to write. They just didn‚Äôt have the vibe or the furniture or the environment. I wanted to move into a proper 5 star with a boost of income or find an affordable AIRBNB without any landlord.

OTT platforms were coming up in the market and commissioning a lot of content. I was constantly badgering Sanjay to hit while the metal is hot, but it was like talking to def ears. Contacted Guneet again but she didn‚Äôt seem interested at this time, something else was ongoing. Had contacted Ashwin Agrawal to come aboard TGIRT when Surbhi and Mithun dropped out and stayed in touch sporadically. Tried myself to reach out to Platforms, though being careful after the experience with Culture Machine and others. I really embraced SWA, only way to register at that time was printed scripts. I used to print them at the nearby printing shop in Lokhandwala and get it stamped at the SWA office. They liked oil you lend a bit of a hand by turning pages as every page was stamped one by one till they online registration was started few months later. That whole process was a lot of fun as I used to meet old writers and retired kinda executives for small talk.

Used to stay either Hotel Golden Swan or Aircraft International Hotel was convenient to get anywhere for meetings being a central location right next to Avion Hotel in front of the Airport. They were clean but otherwise not up to the mark in terms of Culture. The owners were nice, they dropped me to the Airport couple of times. But not pocket friendly, could only stay in Mumbai for 2.5 weeks max based on its rates, and my income.

That‚Äôs when I saw a listing for Urban Pod Hotel on [Makemytrip.com](http://Makemytrip.com), it was the Japanese capsule hotel concept but they had a photo of window over looking a garden. Cheaper than anything else in the market, good reviews about cleanliness and I thought WTF, it‚Äôs only a temporary arrangement. This was in Santa Cruz, East‚Ä¶closer to Powai. Anyway, had to check it out. Booked a private room rather than a pod. 

It was right next to a garage, right in front of Santacruz Electronics Export Processing Hub, better known as SEEPZ on the 1st floor of a corporate building known as Opus Park. Few steps towards the right of the building was a fast food shop mainly serving Samosa and Vada Pao ran by older women and bus stops on either side. It was extremely busy area, especially during peak times.

This hotel was definitely one of its kinds, not only because of the sleeping but because of it‚Äôs cafe‚Äî> surrounded by glass windows on the side of the main road, overlooking the chaos up close rather than from the perspective of the higher floors and yet, detached. The hotel itself was like they were still trying to find PMF, it was somewhere between a hostel and a hotel because of the communal toilets and pod system, while being neither. The toilets were the best thing about the hotel, they design was almost perfect and could have been in any 4 star hotel.

At the front desk were Mehul, Jessica, Saurav and Vivek mainly, locals from Mumbai. Remember being scared of staying in the pod as Mehul told and then showed the private room which was basically a pod in the room with another pod above it opening in the outside aisle. I have always been claustrophobic, this was a nightmare in the making as far as I was concerned. But it was all pristinely clean. The shoes had to be taken outside the main pods area, near the reception, in lockers, it all opened with the same card. This guy assured me that I‚Äôll be fine in the room. lol. On the first night I slept outside the actual pod on the carpeted floor. Other than the cleanliness, these private pod rooms had a massive window which meant sunlight in the morning even though the view itself was of a burned down dirty building of the massive garage.

Breakfast was included in the plan! It was the usual spread that you find in any 2 to 3 star hotels, nothing to write home about. The main guy running the Illy cafe used to keep it to himself but still interesting because he would always keep an eye on all the guests. It felt a drag to have breakfast before 10am when I didn‚Äôt have any meetings but still it was included, so what can you do?! Not allowed to take food inside. 

Stayed there for the booked dates, but thought I am never coming back again after checking out.

Sanjay had released a movie ‚ÄòMy Birthday Song‚Äô in the meanwhile, it is one of the worst movies ever. I was thinking, you can produce and act in that but you have problem in producing TGIRT?! Like WTF. He visited Facebook‚Äôs office in the meanwhile and wanted to make content for them. Fine! I wrote a script as per discussions with him, sent it to him. He even liked it but never told me what happened as to the sale?! Till this day.

I also met respected Mrs. Suri, Sanjay‚Äôs mother at his office, she was amazing and nice with amazing aura. Has passed away since, my condolences üôèüèæü§ç. You know, once you meet someone‚Äôs mother and wife, than it‚Äôs difficult to tell them off. 

Yes, he has an office around the block to ‚ÄòLeaping Windows‚Äô, next to a beauty salon. It was a two room set with his minion sitting in one room and himself in the other room.

Anyway, Sanjay finally agreed to pitch and produce YAMX. I Indianised the whole concept as originally it was based in New York, New York! And made a show bible with the script for 2 full episodes. That took some time. But I delivered as advised and thought it‚Äôs in the pipeline at least. The series was now set in a building called Kanchanjanga Towers. Just random because I had visited a building called Kanchanjanga where uncle used to live. Nothing more or less. Could have changed later‚Äî> Keep a note.

Sanjay told me it was being shared with Times Network who had just purchased MX Player. Fine we were onto something. 

In the meanwhile, I kept sharing the stuff I was writing while also pushing him to pitch Doordarshan 2.0 to someone as well.

I had another meeting with Sanjay to write a concept note for one of his own project to direct and star alongside Tannishtha Chaterjee titled ‚ÄúA Heavenly Affair.‚Äù I was like ‚Äúwhat a joke, everyone wants to be a director now?‚Äù It‚Äôs a specialised skills only few people can be trusted to carry out properly. lol. Whatever. Had to put my ego aside and get on with the work! 

The outline Sanjay provided was abysmal, had no scope. Needed complete rewrite. Had a story brewing in my head for a while, and decided to incorporate that into this.

I delivered rewritten concept note ‚ÄúA Heavenly Affair‚Äù to Sanjay. He had not paid me anything yet. We had a meeting. Tannishtha was also there. They kept talking for about 15 mins, waiting for me to speak. I just wanted to listen. 

Obviously, it was mostly changed, told them the original was a short film at best, not a series. There was no world to build around, you can only stretch it enough.

We agreed to another draft of the concept note. Which I reworked again and delivered again. 

The Books Detour‚Äî>

Few weeks before all this, I had been in touch with Sid Jain again, it was sometime he was back from his international trip and had started a new business. The Story Ink, to help producers and platforms option books for digital content. Kinda like a literary agent but along for the whole ride. I could have used another source of income because if you haven‚Äôt guessed, Mumbai is expensive. Had already shared my projects with him and told him about Sanjay‚Äôs involvement. I also had recently found a really interesting book titled ‚ÄúA Feast of Vultures‚Äù which I thought definitely deserved OTT series treatment. But only as a rough guideline and inspiration with fictional characters + stories. He told me that Guneet Monga had brought the same book to him at Hotstar but was a no go for some reason.

It was always interesting to visit his office, filled with all kinds of collectibles. Like you have landed at the best shop for fantasy, sci-fi and other things. Now with many books as well.

He asked me to write a short treatment and share it with him to figure out if anything could be done about it.

Back to regular programming‚Äî> 

Sanjay told me we got a meeting with Times Group for YAMX as they liked the pitch. I thought this could be start of something, finally. Nothing happens in a decade kind of thing? 

However, during the same weekend was a function in Delhi celebrating Arpit‚Äôs wedding anniversary, he had come all the way from Seattle. I am reluctant in attending functions generally, but I owed them little money to uncle and him as mentioned here [THE RAIN MAKERS‚Äî> Story + Personal](THE%20RAIN%20MAKERS%E2%80%94%20Story%20+%20Personal%20548a2785251144b3bf7cdb792eb7d0bf.md), wanted to show my face to not look like trying to avoid. The most money I spent on a round trip domestic flight because the meeting with times was on Monday. Took me 3 months to pay it off from the credit card.

Detour‚Äî>

There was a guy staying at the hotel named Yuri, said he was a Mexican Airplane engineer, transferring some important part without which the Airplane won‚Äôt fly. He would travel between different destinations all the time, and was only staying at the pods hotel because of some trouble with the allowances. Yuri said something profound Just before I was leaving for this round trip, i kept thinking about while staring at the massive fans inside the domestic terminal‚Äî> ‚Äúeverything happens for a reason.‚Äù

Regular programming‚Äî>

It was the strangest function ever. Bad vibes. The elder sister who knew Sanjay was also there along with family. Whatever. Not much there, I guess. Why would it be?! Hold this thought #1.

Back in Mumbai. We had the meeting for YAMX with Pretti and Sachin, they were fine professionals. Liked the concept. We sent them a proper submission as requested.

In the next meeting, Sanjay promised to pay me Rupee 2 Lakhs to write ‚ÄòA Heavenly Affair‚Äô, that was not the usual rate, but I thought whatever, let‚Äôs just get going.

We were also talking about his brother in law and doing something in Augmented reality. I was not interested in AR at this point other than experimentation. My interest has always been in developing AR as compute interface whilst it has been limited to only marketing related solutions due to hardware limitations. Also, I was still working with Mr. Arya on the bid for the Jaipur project, and with all the writing along with the side job, there was no time or scope unless a really well paid project was presented. 

Startup thoughts were in the background for now. I would rather make movies than to build random apps, and had no capacity to look for a suitable cofounder. Therefore, I immediately turned down that possibility, but helped them with a link to a market place for digital projects, in case they were interested. Felt the equation slightly changed in the next meeting.

We had some notes for YAMX from MX player. I worked them and sent it. They still wanted more changes. We had a call with Sachin to clear things where I explained the changes because he said he couldn‚Äôt notice them. But I agreed to do more changes if they required. He was supposed to get back to Sanjay. 

In the meanwhile, Sanjay told me that we should also pitch it to other companies like Applause Entertainment, Netflix etc. He sent it to them but they did not reply as far as I was told.

I insisted on getting the advance from Sanjay before delivering 1 episode and detailed synopsis for 2-8 episodes of ‚ÄúThe Heavenly affair‚Äù‚Äî> Rs. 30,000.00 That‚Äôs all I have been paid till this date after delivering as promised. He would always change the topic whenever it came to paying the money. Once, I insisted and was told that ‚Äúwhat if I delete everything you have written and revert to the original.‚Äù Okay?! That‚Äôs almost black mail. While paying the Rs. 30,000‚Äî> he told me a story about Shiv ji and Parvati Ji and how good things should not be taken for granted. Ohkay?! 

Just to round this thread off, flash forward to December 2018‚Äî>

Sanjay and me were attending Film Bazaar in Goa. We met Pretti from MX Player, out of the blue she asked ‚Äúwhy did you declined to rewrite YAMX? Rupees 10 to 12 lakhs is a good amount of money.‚Äù I looked at Sanjay immediately who was also standing there. I was never told that they asked for a rewrite and were paying that amount. He changed the conversation instantly. Asshole. Why?! Of course, I would have taken that offer.

Back to the future, Life in motion‚Äî>

In btw all this had found about a contest organised by ‚ÄòCinestaan‚Äô a film company funded by Mahindra Group‚Äôs family office. The winning synopsis was supposed to win a grant to write the feature film. They were not looking for an animated film particularly but I thought let‚Äôs just try! You never know. This type of stuff also works as motivation to get things done. I did not win the contest but it was their loss because Hex was a winning idea. Hold this thought #2.

I contacted Ashwin Agrawal to produce HEX. He had joined Rhythm and Hues as production co-ordinator about a year after I had been there, and now working as a producer for his own company NGCS, based in China along with his wife Natasha Shetty, also worked at Rhythm and Hues. I first shared the synopsis with him, but it was mutually agreed that we needed a script.

But had a month tentatively to deliver 1 episode full script and synopsis for the rest of the 7 episodes of ‚ÄúA Heavenly Affair‚Äù, and thought, what will happen to the animation project if I get too busy in YAMX and, it looks like Sanjay‚Äôs will definitely make his project with Tannishtha. lol. Therefore, decided to write the whole animated feature film script within a week, and then concentrate on Sanjay‚Äôs project.

Focus‚Äî>

Steve Jobs has been a major influence. I used to follow Elon Musk since the ‚ÄòIron Man‚Äô movie came out in 2008, and admired his approach for building the Falcon 9 rocket in the face of extreme and unnecessary criticism. Also, read about how he moved from venture to venture to Space X and Tesla. Sure, the domains were different, but work is work‚Äî> Hex was going be my ‚ÄòZip2‚Äô, the venture that puts me in major money to build the next thing.

Worked 20 hours a day with sporadic breaks and naps to finish the HEX script within a week at the Urban Pod hotel‚Äôs cafe. You see, all my writing process was missing was this cafe! It was not the best cafe but exactly what I needed. I first wanted to have a table and chair to write in my private pod, but hotel ‚Äúrules‚Äù didn‚Äôt allow it. In the beginning, it was difficult with constant distractions but I got used to tuning out the noise with music and focus.

At the same time, spending this much time during the day in Public, did wonders to fix any remaining anxiousness issues. Anytime i would feel tired, this place worked as a live comedy set with one or other comedian hanging around for a quick chat.

The settings‚Äî>

I had moved to ‚ÄòThe Urban Pod‚Äô kinda full time by now. Mumbai is probably the only Indian city with truly global vibes and vibrant culture, it‚Äôs not reflected anywhere better than at a hotel. Especially, at a hotel like this one. Open 24x7. Close to the Airport. It was too low end for the actually rich, too niche for the regular travellers, clean and convenient to bring back anyone upon initial a visit. Top of the list as an option if you can‚Äôt afford anything better, looking only for a place to stay, and want value for money. It was made for anyone in btw things. Neither here, nor there. A kind of place to maximise chances of meeting your soulmate?

Back flash Detour‚Äî> 

Had already met a few interesting people at the hotel by now. I like speaking to strangers, especially anyone lonely. Among them were an old Malaysian Bussiness man who was trying to set me up with a girl named Muskaan, also staying there for extended time. Initially, I was a bit spooked out that she looked like Perin, house mate from London. We were all sitting in a group, i asked her out to watch a football game. The old Malaysian man teased her by saying something stupid like she wants to go out with me but not him, and I made sarcastic comment towards him as the dude was in his 70‚Äôs. Suddenly, he started shouting at me like crazy. Had to walk away to not let it escalate, and ignore the whole situation including her for my peace of mind. That was probably not ideal, but whatever.

Walking away from a ridiculous situation is not a sign of weakness but strength. You need to pick your fights. I did not love that girl. It was not worth my time.

A Merchant Navy Captain preparing for his exam was also staying there for about 3 months. We became cafe friends, and shared couple of meals. He appreciated my jokes and said ‚Äúhumours is essential for survival in a place like this.‚Äù True words. He used to work for Maersk, the shipping company‚Äî> one of the directors of that company was owned this hotel. I knew nothing about the shipping industry, he told me some informed and hilarious stories himself. Had to tell Captain about Muskaan paying less money than him for the stay, which had him a bit furious and arguing with the management before leaving. Just trying to help a friend ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This is a good point to talk about the hotel management. It was mainly run by three people‚Äî> Mathias, middle aged ‚ÄúSaul Goodman‚Äù without a lawyers degree but doing hotel sales. Initially, I thought he‚Äôs the manager because he used to be the only one hanging around the cafe and they all dressed same. Ashwin, second in command, he was the most talkative of the lot and could be a politician because he lacked basic understanding of politics. Both were fine, and we were friendly. Last but not the least‚Äî> Ajay, the general manager. The ‚ÄúGus Fring‚Äù of Mumbai. lol. Silently running the operation, you would never guess he even exits till we were introduced.

Regular Programming‚Äî>

Sanjay‚Äôs treacherous and ridiculous character has already been revealed to the readers, but I was not yet aware of the whole extent in $$$ terms. Therefore, kept sharing stuff with him because you never know. We were working to send TGIRT to the Film Bazaar Co Production market. So, he was officially producing this film. Alright.

As the script was already in place and good feedback. You basically keep drafting it from then onwards. I sent it to Black List and it received between 6 to 7 rating along with 8 for settings which is considered good on that website as almost nothing receives 10 out of 10. Other than the numbers, the feedback in words was even more encouraging. It‚Äôs a commercial film in the animation genre. Hold that thought #3. 

Thought, maybe we could get Sanjay‚Äôs help for introducing for Hex as well. Ashwin was visiting Mumbai from Beijing. We arranged a meeting at Blue Tokai, Versova. His wife Ambika was also there, they had other meetings as well. I asked him if has read ‚ÄòThe Great Indian Rope Trick‚Äô, Ambika replied instead‚Äî> ‚ÄúIt was so funny! I loved it!‚Äù He instantly gave her a STFU look. She‚Äôs wonderful and honest. We came out of that meeting and didn‚Äôt think he‚Äôll could be helpful for Hex. Still shared the script with him.

The Book Detour‚Äî>

I wrote a fictional treatment for ‚ÄúA Feast of Vultures‚Äù and shared it with Sid. He did say it was interesting but nothing more happened. I even wrote a more detailed treatment upon his feedback, everyone who read it also loved it.

In the meanwhile, thought this book thing is interesting and maybe, I can do it with Sanjay? Make some deals with OTT platforms, make some connections. I asked Sid to give me a job, but he kept ignoring that topic. It really bothered me when he questioned the validity of my on set experience. Had he been told something fake by Jake?! After all I did put them in touch.

One book interested me in particular titled ‚Äú**JADOOWALLAHS, JUGGLERS AND JINNS‚Äù by John Zubrzycki.** 

![IMG_0459.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Bollywood%20Edition%20Part%202%E2%80%94%20Perso%202e28364178774f0c933eeb4ff0ebb708/IMG_0459.jpeg)

I wrote directly to John, and he recommended me to Mr. Anuj Bahri of Bahrison Books to discuss the rights. Did all the research about Mr. Bahri as I do about everyone before meeting, and then visited him at his book store in Khan Market, New Delhi. Had never visited Khan Market before that, and the only time I heard about it was from a potential investor situated at Abdul Kalam road, near Embassy of Israel. He owned a space in Khan Market, wanting us to turn it into a Virtual Reality gallery. 

Mr. Bahri shared a ‚ÄòMathi‚Äô, an Indian snack from a jar on his desk, it was damp. I have had better Mathi‚Äôs buddy. He‚Äôs old with grey hair and big moustache. We had small talk then decided to meet for dinner at ‚ÄòMr. Choy‚Äô in Khan Market itself on his recommendation. Got there on time, he came a little later. Started talking about his daughter and her book, of course I already knew about it from the research. Also about ‚ÄúHickey‚Äôs Gazette‚Äù about Asia‚Äôs first printing press setup by an Irish person in Kolkata. Then he was doing the usual things that everyone does in showbiz, talking about everyone he knows. 

Introduced me to the owner of Mr. Choy. Then ordered some fancy whisky. I thought how expensive could it be after all?! Go ahead, enjoy yourself old man.

He started talking about having plenty of manuscripts that no one wants to buy. Then about ‚ÄòAmir Khan‚Äô backing out of a deal for one of the book he was trying to sell. I thought, if Amir couldn‚Äôt deal with him, then what chance do I stand?! He was already quoting really high figures, and in the process of ordering more food as well! So, i made an excuse to leave. The bill was little under 10 grand. That‚Äôs the most I had spent in 5 years on a single meal. Should have taken the whisky bottle! lol. We spoke couple of other times on WhatsApp, and are kinda friends now, i think ü•É¬†

Picked a fortune cookie at ‚ÄòMr. Choy‚Äô that I shared with Charu Gupta, a friend, at that time. I met her at SixD, and she seemed curious. I had been trying to keep up with the youths, so as to stay relevant in writing about contemporary culture. Also, I used to make a conscious effort to understand women and girls to write about them, because I am already a men. You can‚Äôt objectively write about women knowing all the things they go through, but not understanding any of it. It‚Äôs a whole other world. The basic idea of women carrying a human being in their womb is scary to me as a man, just think about it. Only by that account, the way they think about the world could be so much different and better. Therefore, properly writing about women takes a lot of effort that readers might not even appreciate. But even then, we men can‚Äôt do it true justice. Charu claimed to be a writer herself, but most of her writing was boring self indulgent stuff. It was interesting when she would write or express herself through a song or writing, but not passing judgements on the situation half understood through pseudo psychology. I was never interested in anything more than friendship.

Met Sid couple of more times, he had changed offices. Tried to cancel the meeting at the last minute, because the building elevator had stopped working. I took the stairs to sixth floor, no problem. He was surprised for some reason. Requested him to hire me as a treatment writer for the book, he recommended a book that someone was considering making into a series apparently, but didn‚Äôt have an extra copy to share. Therefore, I had to buy one myself. There‚Äôs no way that book could have been a series because of the strange dynamics, unless of course you fictionalise a lot of things. It was better approachable as a documentary like Wild Wild Country.

I realised during this whole book ordeal about this industry and every book being a whole world in its own, either I can turn books into screenplays or develop original screenplays, and I was more interested in making original movies. 

Regular programming‚Äî>

Ashwin told me that he knows someone at Amir Khan Productions, asked me to put everything together and share with him. I requested to be introduced to this person on email but was never introduced. Sent the HEX pitch as requested, and apparently he sent it over. Never heard about it again. Inquired few more times, but never received a satisfactory answer.

All this while, I kept meeting new people at the hotel. One of them in particular was always lurking around for a month. Eating breakfast in the hotel cafe like it was his backyard, dressed in a vest and reading full spread of the newspaper, but still self conscious‚Äî> Gaurav Mahajan. He was working for a company owed by a Mr. Patel, based on the floor right above The Urban Pod Hotel. I am still unsure of his actual title or role at this company. He was a software architect wanting to become a quant? Mr. Patel acquired him rather than his company, but his co founder, someone associated with AAP, didn‚Äôt opt into that arrangement. That‚Äôs how he needed up in Mumbai but him staying at the hotel remained a mystery other than being noncommittal to an apartment or in general, an attribute we shared. Only difference‚Äî> he had the money to move into an apartment, I didn‚Äôt. If you asked him about goals, would reply ‚ÄúMoving to New York.‚Äù But maybe it was this gullible honesty that had us eventually acquainted.

First time we spoke was through Khushbu Mehta, but before I tell you about her. You have to know about Puja.

You don‚Äôt expect a hotel to have power cuts. They should have backup generator. Especially, a pod hotel, being Air locked with central air conditioning. It was fine for the first few minutes, but then it started getting hot, there was something wrong with the power supply. Electricity was available in some areas of the hotel, but not in others. I came out to the lobby area to inquire, and just then Puja was also merged from the women exclusive pod room. Yes, there was a separate pod room for women with their own washrooms. She was about 5‚Äô from the North East, an entrepreneur or Air hostess‚Ä¶something, IDK. We spoke, I was not interested in anything more than on the spot conversation as she didn‚Äôt seem reliable. She might be fine, but not my type. 

The underground metro work had started right under the road in front of the hotel, there was a lot of activity around this area. The building next door was also under construction. Moving parts and what not.

Puja asked me out once, I had to make an excuse. She kept waiting downstairs with a beer bottle in hand, and I remember sneaking out alone for dinner. Didn‚Äôt want to be rude, but yeah.

Anyway, i had just returned to the hotel from Delhi after about a month, and a women with similar height as Puja is standing around the front desk with a police officer. Quite animated. That‚Äôs Khushbu. Apparently, in my absence, she became friends with Puja, who ended up stealing her expensive make up along with the laptop? It turns out Khushbu is a make up entrepreneur! She would always tell you about her more famous business partner Namrata as the lead makeup artist for one Sonam Kapoor. 

Before you get to know more about Khushbu and Gaurav. We need to go back in time for introductions to few other people.

Back Flash‚Äî>

Right after the incident with the old Malaysian man, I introduced myself to Mahesh Singhal, said he‚Äôs an investment banker. He was also from Faridabad. Okay. I had never met a man with more issues, other than myself, lol. At least, based on what I was told by Mahesh himself. Started his own consultancy business thats been struggling for a while, wife and kids were living away from him, a luxury apartment in Surajkund that he couldn‚Äôt afford. I introduced him to Sandeep Ji, which was probably another mistake. Met few times in Delhi, visited his apartments that he tried to sell or rent out to me. Okay?! He was troubled about having to take money from his brother, and in general with relationships. Once asked me to take a bank loan to loan it to him‚Äî> of course, i turned down that awesome idea. He would sit around whole day, not doing anything, but was still busy if you asked him. Kept in touch, but never figured out how to help him with all this going on in my own life.

Another person I met at the hotel was Prosenjit, staying there around the same time as Yuri, the airplane mechanic. He got offended upon receiving honest feedback about his animation skills.

But a more interesting personality I had encountered at the pods was Nausherwan Shah, an entrepreneur, Jake couldn‚Äôt hold a candle to this guy. He introduced me to couple of companies working in Augmented Reality, and Crypto based in Powai, they seemed legit from the outside. However, most of his stories about himself were not so legit, which was apparent with some basic research. Especially, a story about meeting Mr. Amitabh Bachchan at The Marriott in Juhu for a movie role on behalf of his film producer mom, and finding out that Mr. Bachchan is bald! Well, maybe he‚Äôs, so what?! ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ü´§, but the women producer he kept calling his own mother was actually mother of the dude running the AR marketing company. Ended up being quite impressed with my simplified explanation of Bitcoin. He was young and ambitious, it‚Äôs fine. 

Just around the same time. One night, while sitting in the hotel cafe, doing something on the laptop, I heard a guy talking loudly in American accent. About 6‚Äô5 in printed shirt, bald, white, talking on the phone to some Vivek, trying to convince him to talk to dad to figure out some bank issues like transfer of money, change of currency. This is Dr. Frank from Atlanta, USA. You see, anybody of any means had to have some unique situation, because of which they ended up at this hotel. He seemed shady. I kept to myself while observing him slowly becoming a Bombay hippie, lol.

Frank was also friends with Puja. That‚Äôs totally cool, even after the robbery. I am not judging. First time we had a conversation was when he bought a whisky bottle, and shared it with Mehul at the front desk after mid night. Mehul ended up sharing it with me, and Mahesh Singhal who‚Äôs won‚Äôt leave my side for some reason. Only had about a quarter, i was suspicious of it being adulterated, and being used to steal my kidneys üò±üòÜ

He became friends with a Mexican couple, and ended up meeting a local travel guide con man. Apparently, that made him apprehensive of strangers at the hotel. I came to know he‚Äôs Jewish, which broadened my understanding of the culture, till that time only Jewish people I knew were celebrities in America like Steven Spielberg, Jerry Seinfeld, Paul Heyman, Ariel Helwani‚Ä¶actually Ariel is quite relatable, especially after losing Dana White privilege. lol. Natalie Portman and I have since become ‚Äúinsta friends.‚Äù Finally, I had a real jewish friend in Frank! He was surprised I had seen some films with prominent Jewish cultural references that even he hadn‚Äôt like ‚ÄòA Serious Man‚Äô and ‚ÄòKingdom of heaven.‚Äô

I didn‚Äôt know anything about Israel or Gaza in particular, other than taking side of the underdog few years ago on Facebook, when a clash was highly publicised on Social media. Don‚Äôt want to write too much about this sensitive topic, and I am not taking sides either. But it‚Äôs always good to have a complete perspective about any situation before being judgemental. Well, thats what these essays are about, anyway.

Regular programming‚Äî>

We are in the last quarter of 2018. TGIRT had been short listen for the Film Bazaar Co Production market, fixed the script, and sent it as requested by Sanjay. He had got busy with some acting roles, giving up on pretty much everything else for the time being.

Other than the construction side job, developing new ideas, I was mostly focusing on TGIRT, YAMX and HEX. Drafting, redrafting, and trying to find better collaborators. 

I couldn‚Äôt understand Ashwin‚Äôs approach re Hex, he was trying to club it with his ‚Äúslate.‚Äù None of the other projects had a script or similar appeal, but he had learned a template way of doing things. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how everyone else does it or that‚Äôs how it happens.‚Äù We even had couple of arguments that he tried to win over by aggression, lol. To his credit, he told me at the onset that he‚Äôs does not have experience in actually producing a film, but managing animation production.

Hex‚Äôs budget was tiny at about $25 Million compared to similar high end animation productions, yet substantial, considering it‚Äôs being produced by two people who had never produced a feature film worth $1 million. Sure, we had the aptitude, and talent, but films are a risky business, and investors need to feel at ease, even if it means little when it comes to creativity. We were working on other projects like TGIRT, and thought, the credential problem shall solve itself through one of those projects being green lit. The task ahead of us was getting our hands on some development funding, so that we could package HEX properly.

I had been in touch with all kinds of people while trying to produce ‚ÄòPhil Was There‚Äô and ‚ÄòMiss Z‚Äô, one of them was now working at Netflix as Animation Executive, so I wrote to Alexi re Hex. It‚Äôs useful to keep an eye out. We also discussed upgrading ‚Äúthe brain trust‚Äù by bringing in someone with a name onboard this project. It had to be someone approachable, that we could trust, and after sticking out everyone else due to them not responding, one name stood out‚Äî> Mrs. Saraswathi Balgam/ Vani.

Vani is Prashant Buyyala‚Äôs wife. She was the studio head of Rhythm and Hues Mumbai. When I went for the first round of interview in 2007 after passing a test, Vani was there along with Mr. Prasad and Mr. Subhajit Sarkar‚Äî> told them I am actually a Film Director, lol. She wanted to read anything I had written, so in the next round of interview, I brought printed copy of one page short synopsis of every Idea i had at that time. She didn‚Äôt come to that interview, so I gave the whole bunch to Prem Lohana, a Jr. HR guy to give it to her.

I used to help her around during the job. We once redecorated props for the whole office, all on our own. It was completely unnecessary, now that I think of it, but it was down time, and I was bored. She shared pomegranate with me one evening. Thought, we had a connection. I even contacted them upon hearing the news of Rhythm and Hues being in financial trouble, offering to come onboard ‚ÄúPhil Was There‚Äù, of course, it needed to secure funding.

We looked up her current work status, had some insight as Ashwin‚Äôs wife was in the same group of ex Rhythm and Hues women employees. She was not upto much, other than still bossing people around. lol. This could work. Ashwin said it won‚Äôt help to get her, but Prashant, who‚Äôs a douche. I thought, once we get her on board, we will then get him as well. Someone had to make an actual connection, of course, It was going to be me.

The Urbanpod hotel‚Äî>

At this point, there was no doubt Urban Pod was a great place to know interesting characters. Like a live theatre. It would start right at the breakfast. Khushbu had kinda taken over the cafe, she was kinda making her own breakfast, and you couldn‚Äôt have missed her presence. Either she didn‚Äôt care, was unaware or screaming for attention. 

I had started chatting with Frank quite regularly by now. He told me about some people backing out of funding his venture in India after promising and, that landed him in the soup. Now, he was auditioning for roles in Bollywood! That‚Äôs quite a pivot, I thought. From practising medicine to acting! Wow! It kinda made sense when he told me his business partner was Vivek Oberoi. I was still not completely sure about him. Never asked for introductions, by the way.

It was raining outside, I had a flight to catch, Khusbu was in the cafe, Frank was there, thought, why not?! Introduced them before leaving. And, had started gesture hello to Gaurav by now, like when you move your head in up/down motion while making a face to acknowledge someone.

The Film Bazaar‚Äî>

The Great Indian Rope Trick was rejected after being short listed. This was odd. Almost never happens. Sanjay didn‚Äôt seem that surprised. What can you say or do in such situation?! I was still going to attend the Film Bazaar on my own expense. Whilst Sanjay was being paid by the Film Bazaar to attend along with accommodation. Sure. Because he made a really awesome film in ‚ÄúMy Birthday Song‚Äù, i guess?

At the Delhi Airport, I met a female journalist from the Press Trust of India. We had a good conversation, though didn‚Äôt know what to tell her. It was a mess of a situation. 

This was only my second time attending Film Bazaar, I had registered once in btw to get the contact list, but didn‚Äôt waste money in attending because its useless without a selected project. You can meet any of those people through out the year in the city. I thought Sanjay was going to push, and arrange meetings for TGIRT or other projects, but he didn‚Äôt. On the first evening. I had just arrived at the Ocean facing back garden of the hotel for evening drinks, said hello to Sanjay. But right then, I received an email from Alexi of Netflix, asking to send the script for Hex! Alright! I almost ran back to the hotel room to proofread the script before sending it. As far as I was concerned, you take what you can, and we were in talks with Netflix International for an animated feature film. Told Sanjay about it, probably shouldn‚Äôt have, but he was curious as to why I left in a hurry.

Another notable meeting I had was with Tessa Inkelaar of Cinestaan. Other than sending Hex to their contest, first time I had heard about them was from Tisca Chopra in the meeting for TGIRT. Same, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs connect back in Mumbai.‚Äù

Repeat‚Äî> On the second evening, we met Pretti from MX Player, out of the blue she asked ‚Äúwhy did you declined to rewrite YAMX? Rupees 10,00000 to 12,00000 is a good amount of money.‚Äù I looked at Sanjay immediately, standing right there. I was never told that they asked for a rewrite and were paying that amount. He changed the conversation instantly. Asshole. Why?! Of course, I would have taken that offer. Being pissed off is an understatement. I had no trust left in this person now.

It gets awkward hanging around with this person who knows everyone, but is a complete douche bag. Also, have you been around so much fakneess at the same place?! It‚Äôs difficult to handle a bunch of people making crap, acting like each of them is the second coming of Satyajit Ray or Martin Scorsese, but with a template mindset. Did they have a template?! Spent most of the time walking around the beaches. I was interested in making movies, not keep talking about making movies. Here‚Äôs a script, we can talk about improving it or change it, or whatever you want. But what is this endless talk about?! I already knew all the business models, you are either are in the business of making movies or talking about them. I am in the business of doing, building things. Rest are side activities.

Didn‚Äôt have money for much else. Some food and whisky at a nearby Thai restaurant. Had a Bloody Mary for take away! lol. 

During the same event, I received an email from ‚ÄòCreative Artist Agency‚Äô representing ‚Äú**JADOOWALLAHS, JUGGLERS AND JINNS‚Äù by John Zubrzycki.** Think, I told them about having no plans at the moment.

Sanjay recommended that I watch some movies screening in the distribution section, and let him know if there‚Äôs anything good. He was distributing movies to digital platforms by now like ‚ÄòVillage Rockstars by Rima Das.‚Äô I picked some documentaries, one of them was by Saraswathi Balgam about an American women‚Äôs Journey to become a Yogini, based in Uttarakhand. Felt it had some potential, but needed better editing, so I emailed her. Universe putting things together ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. There was another documentary about a traditional festival with bullock cart racing in Tamil Nadu which was shot really well.

Back at the Hotel‚Äî>

Next I showed up there, Khushbu and Gaurav were apparently dating. lol. ü§£. I found that really funny for some reason. I was in the cafe most of the time, working on something, and they would be hanging around often. She actually properly introduced me to Gaurav, and that how we got talking. Frank had left already for the holidays, but was due to be back next year. 

A missed flight‚Äî>

I had an early morning Air India flight on 2nd Jan from Mumbai to Delhi. After being late by half n hour already, there was a further 4 hours delay, though everyone was already on the plane. It was stuck on the runway. Heard a women crying on the seat behind me. Tried to speak to her, after some effort she told me that she‚Äôs coming from Goa, going to St. Petersburg, Russia. But was going to miss the connecting flight because of this delay. She just won‚Äôt stop crying! There was someone‚Äôs anniversary, she didn‚Äôt wanna miss it, whatever. I sat next to her, and tried my best to calm her down by playing all the scenarios while trying to make her understand that it doesn‚Äôt matter, she‚Äôll be fine! She would understand for a second, but then star crying again. Kept crying throughout the flight as well. Even time calculated everything, found her customer care‚Äôs contacts for the connecting flight, and even spoke to them myself. She just won‚Äôt stop crying.

As soon as the flight landed, I called the customer care again, it was too late as boarding was finished. We still ran to the counter of that airline‚Ä¶think it was Lufthansa?! Can‚Äôt confirm. Again, I tried to convince them every way I could, but it didn‚Äôt work. She had money, I helped her book the next flight which was to take off in like 12 hours or something. Told her about plenty of hotels around there, if she wanted to rest, this was not an invitation! But she looked at me funny, and said ‚Äúwhat do you mean, why would I want a hotel?‚Äù I meant nothing! We hugged goodbye, I left. Never seen her again, obviously.

World Aids Day and Thailand‚Äî>

One meeting in September, I was asked by Sanjay to write a special 30 to 40 mins script for Worlds AIDS Day that Onir had been asked to make by someone at ‚ÄòZee Entertainment‚Äô. He also supplied a brief. Did not introduce me to Onir till this day. Not that I cared either. It was really different from everything I had written, therefore, an interesting challenge. 

During that time, a dude was staying at the hotel, about similar height, a goatee, and obviously shady. I got to talk to him. Paid for his lunch at Subway, because he did not have money. Even gave him some money for dinner. He had a whole story about being In Mumbai for his divorce proceedings, but is living in Thailand working in bars by finding customers, his wife wont let him meet his son, it‚Äôs all her fault bla bla. Asks me for Rupees 20,000.00 because he doesn‚Äôt have the money in his account that he needs to show at the immigration counter to enter Thailand as a tourist. I was just surprised that he didn‚Äôt even have a work visa! Fine. Live your life, I am not here to judge. But then he tried every emotional trick to extract the money.

If you don‚Äôt have the money then don‚Äôt go to Thailand?! What am I missing? But he was adamant. Asks me to sell my phone. lol. Then asks me to buy his phone, but when I made a mock offer‚Äî> ‚Äúwhat will you do with my phone? What will I do without my phone?‚Äù lol. This guy was something else. I had to sneak out of the hotel to avoid him. But he still found me! At one point, I offered him the money in exchange for writing this story for World AIDS day or at least a basic premise. No questions asked. He plain refused and accused me of not wanting to give him the money! ü§£¬†I didn‚Äôt want to give him the money, it‚Äôs obvious. But I was ready to give him the money if he had written this thing. He didn‚Äôt even try. In fact, called me names while leaving, was shouting at the front desk about me! Like what?! 

Anyway, I wrote and, delivered this script for World AIDS day. Sanjay even liked it. But never heard back from him, and never got paid anything to write this either. 

The Grand Loop‚Äî>

I was pushing Sanjay to make something, wrote a short series titled ‚ÄúThe Grand Loop.‚Äù He was up for the idea. Something that could be shot, and made without needing to be commissioned. Sent it to him. Didn‚Äôt hear about it either.
