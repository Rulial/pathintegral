    I am aligned with humanity and everything non fiction is written from that perspective by default. Then, it's mentioned when other layers are added on top.
    
    Nothing in this document is written for any specific individual or organization or government, therefore, no one should take unnecessary offence.
    
    If I wanted to address anything specific than specific examples would have been given alongside with evidence to make a proper point with responsibility.
    
    This has nothing to do with any Geo Political Issues whatsoever.
    

We are at a crucial juncture for human civilisation in terms of building the future at least from our narrow, self important perspective. An opportunity I am excited about being part of rather than scared.

It's exciting because previously innovations were about loosely charting a few decades though this time its about loosely charting centuries. But it could be another mess if we act out of fear and control dynamics of power rather than our inbuilt kindness and curiosity. This is not only a nice sounding statement but a practical construct of progress through technology that needs to be multi dimensional in performance—> outcomes.

Technology is not only about gadgets but every bit of tangible or intangible tools at our disposal throughout history to construct a present towards a better future—> extremely well depicted in 2001: A Space Odyssey by Stanley Kubrick.

We wouldn't be where we are today had our ancestors been afraid of developing or using tools that were the technology of their era and so on, time after time. Sure, some people must have tried to spread paranoid hysteria in each of those historical instances but we persevered to find ourselves in this moment.

It's important to be concerned which is completely different from being paranoid—> therefore, its also important to realize progress never failed us as a species whether its climate change or crime, greed did and still does. Wait, think again—> Greed is also part of being human, of this experience but it needs to be channeled and contained for progress to take precedent in the right direction.

 It's not easy either when one thinks about the enormous scale of this whole endeavor that is global human civilisation even when looked upon with different classification metrics and in sub groups. It's a wonder that any of this works at all, but it does quite well and is largely not dependent on anything in particular but our interdependence and interconnectedness—> mechanisms for which need to be continually developed and improved upon to keep working seamlessly.

I have a nack for pattern spotting, its a natural reaction to solve any chaos by application of first principles and finding simplicity. Though, other calculations kick in for a realisation—> out there even speed of light and everything else by that effect is bound to the laws of physics. There are mechanisms of nature we don't know yet or have not completely figured out but that's not a debate about all of existence being based on natural laws which should not be confused with only our definition of things.

It's easy to get scared or even feeling envious—> “people developing this tech will have more power, we think we are not doing this "right" without enough information, therefore, we will double down on the negativity for this tech to naively think progress can be halted or this type of activities are a way to get a stake hold” but the truth if you chose to see—> modern economies are subject to monopolistic practices, therefore, concentrated in the hands of the few in terms of decision or change making power—> everyday technology on the other hand is not even possible without mass participation, case in point—> iPhone and Android.

There are entities who would take advantage of such negative economic or tech sentiments to work in their own favour by any manipulative means necessary because of either personal, political or corporate narcissism which has nothing to do with the welfare of the industry or society. Everyone is guilty of this behavioural black hole of wanting it all, not excluding myself or singling out anyone else for the record. Primary issue being that monopolies of any kind do not workout in the long term but do create voids in industry and related marketplaces because of being based in greed rather than on laws of progress. There is nothing more important for sustainable growth than harbouring an environment of healthy competition—> more like a sport and less like a game. 

No, tech is not perfect and there remain many many big problems with the current tools to function optimally but there's also constant progress being made to build them better. The pace of new solutions getting adapted in practice is a matter of finding a balance with relative variables, which is also important.

Lets consider science an art in service of a spiritual journey to many tangible experiences and intangible realisations. The point being that doing something should not be looked upon as struggle or an accomplishment, we all follow our own unique path, therefore, need to leave that mindset behind—> the real struggle that each of us should be concerned with is doing things right and optimally from a human perspective.

These are still early days in AI, there's a long way to go, no one has all the answers or all the correct answers, not even the current AI itself but we can and will get there by building and shipping and iterating 🤯 🙏
