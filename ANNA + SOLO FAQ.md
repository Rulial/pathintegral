# ANNA + SOLO FAQ

# **Actively Raising U$D 1 Million Pre Seed**

ANNA—> AI Native Game Engine.

SOLO—> Head Band. At first, we’ll only be building a prototype for testing which shall evolve into a consumer device.

ANNA + SOLO will be the Next Generation of AI Native Personal/ Wearable Computer.

 + a video game 🎮 version of 🍦THE GRAND LOOP, a book I am writing. It’ll be used for experimentation, and initial revenue. 

This is an **AI Native tech Startup**, and not a research or gaming company.

Expect transparent communication with constant updates of practical progress if you engage and invest.

Feel free to ask your own questions directly via hello@path-integral.com or social media. This is where I try to feel important by asking all these questions of myself based on general feedback collected from the internet. You’re welcome.

FAQ has no sarcasm.

1. “Is there a roadmap?” 

—> This is a roadmap, not account of every step. 

We shall also be building some custom hardware equipment + software with privacy and security concerns. This custom equipment will be only for internal development use, and not for sales. 

Though, it’s not possible to share technical details at this stage, interested technical parties can ascertain the scope and tangibility of the stealth hypothesis from the roadmap itself—>

/Secure a book deal from a known publisher for ‘The Grand Loop’—> start writing as a separate project in parallel.

Bootstrap the AI Native venture with part of this book deal money. 

Below are the major check points on Path Integral startup map—>

Bootstrap stage—> Build the SOLO Head Band prototype. 

\ Secure Pre seed USD 1 Million funding round 

—> Parallel building ANNA, AI Native Game Engine. I’ll be putting together a prototype build myself. 

\ Secure Seed funding round

—> Explore bringing in co founder and start hiring at this stage.

—> Build the Grand 🍦 Loop game.

—> Release paid version 1.0 of the AI native game engine + The Grand Loop Game for free.

\ Secure Series A funding round  

—> Release the open source version.

—> Release version 1.1 of AI native game engine.

—> 2 to 3 years for the completion of the above stages.

—> From there, it would be roughly 5 years journey of bringing ANNA + SOLO to the consumer market as next generation AI Native Personal/ Wearable Computer—> the IPO. Give or take 8 to 10 years from pre seed funding to IPO and global market footprint.

—> We might pivot to space tech including modular robots on the side during that period or definitely after the IPO—> [PATH INTEGRAL SPACE TECH PRESENTATION](https://www.notion.so/PATH-INTEGRAL-SPACE-TECH-PRESENTATION-13c6623756748075b3cbd1574aa57c3b?pvs=21) 

#Please reach out If you want to invest directly.

#Timeline is tentative—> somethings could happen faster and some slower.

#It’s important that we start this journey as early as possible in 2025. There are many people around the world taking missteps in ignorance, which will make the development unnecessarily complicated. You can email or direct message on social media to open a dialogue.

1. “Are you also building any hardware device?” 

—> We will be building a SOLO ‘Head Band’ prototype only for myself to test. In time, it shall evolve into a consumer device.

Note that It’s a ‘Head Band’, and not a ‘Head Set.’ There are many ideas, but let’s say the primary idea is being on the right side of privacy, and transparency. 

The data in your head belongs to you by default, unless you choose to share it. Everything else is an additional super features on top of that basic purpose.

1. “What do you think about Robotics?” 

—> Robotics vary by domain. Manufacturing industry has been using different applications of robotics for a while contributing in safety and productivity, being a process driven domain. More efficient and better use of Robotics in manufacturing will only help society as its really a waste of human mind to watch over assembly line tasks—> it will open more creative roles as you would always need the human input.

Humanoid robots on the other hand is an exciting tech but far from practical or useful and is more of an intrusive nuisance in day to day life which is already becoming too robotic. A self driving car is fine and useful as long as it works without problems on the road but you don’t necessarily want that in your living room or kitchen or bedroom or washroom. 

My bet is on developing multipurpose + modular robots which are not a replacement for the human connection, less of a nuisance, but more of a utility.

And [“What are your thought re use of AI in military applications?”](ANNA%20+%20SOLO%20FAQ%20ed09f44607894d988c39d3c37c3a593f.md) 

1. “What are your thoughts about AI regulations?” 

—> AI products can be regulated via open + transparent protocols though regulating research and development does not make any sense as they not only thrive but are only possible as open fields of curiosity. Unless, someone is looking to hand over all the advantage to incumbents or selective new comers, therefore, stalling long term progress for short term gains.

Also, if you the reader for a second would think without contempt, offence and bias which is also known as open mindedness…..for a change—> have been constantly talking about building evolving protocols(plural) which is basically regulations but coded along with documentation, minus any hubris but audited for irregularities and cracks.

1. “But many important people are worried about AI being a major threat.” I would like to keep this brief and non technical because when so many people are wrong there’s money in the answer though, this FAQ is not exactly “lucrative” —>

Technically, there is NO WAY any current or future AI models will be able to initiate below scenarios ON ITS OWN in any capacity. Anyone suggesting otherwise is a fan of science fiction + a troll.

As anyone can read in the Tweets/X’s, never have I said that AI does not pose any risks—> near future risks are quick generation and wide distribution of misinformation by human entities using this technology + social media. It would be really expensive to formulate such an coordinated attack which would also need to pass already established guardrails in every sector and domain—> extremely unlikely, difficult and expensive to say the least unless backed by a well equipped nation state. The usefulness and benefits of current AI development far out weighs these outlier risks.

The global community is technically capable of taking measures to prevent this from becoming a wide spread phenomenon at any scale, just in case with protocols. Also, that we are not totally reliant on technology as a preventive measure, part of the solution is not-promoting mob thinking—> by the way.

Many people also confuse unrealistic possibilities with developing capabilities or science with science fiction or over stating capabilities to create hype because hype brings attention for raising money. 

Far future risk—> Use of AI for defence purposes and activities is already regulated and should be regulated. It’s not like just about anyone is capable of producing weapons in the real world. I would like to address this with technical details but in fact this would be much easier to tackle compared to the misinformation risk.

Let’s forget the established guardrails and assume someone crazy is able to find all the hardware + software without anyone on earth having a clue and lets only consider advances in satellite surveillance using AI—> we would know if someone is building a huge army of Robots with super advanced AI before it becomes an actual or perceived threat of any kind, let alone an “extinction level threat.” None of the current development in Robotics are even close to these kind of capabilities. Again, none of this is executable by any AI system in labs or production on its own—> that’s science fiction. Those plot holes in movies are because they don’t actually have technical information even after spending hundred of millions and not only to maintain narrative pace along with seamless editing. Otherwise, everyone will make science fiction movies rather than producing research papers.

It’s not like you can just put together a bunch of GPU’s to make music, movies or gaming content or statistical analysis of data or code apps for regulated App Stores but are actually ready to take over the entire Earth and also near by planets along with rest of the solar system. While at it, why not also conquer other galaxies, you know. WTF are we even talking about? 

ChatGPT is not capable of such advances. There is no technical way for GPT of the future on any advanced mechanics of RLHF or even the most advanced algorithms currently out there to attain sentience. 

There is no such switch that I or anyone on the internet knows of but then we also don’t know if UFO’s exists or not, either. The point being—> none of this sci-fi stuff has anything to do with based product development using machine learning and computer vision.

Like I had mentioned at the beginning, all of the above and much more disinformation around this topic is provable technically as being only that. Will publish details in our official blog after starting.

1. “What about jobs, doesn’t more AI means less jobs for humans?” 

—> No, that is not true. We need to look at this in terms of technical capabilities, production and phases. 

Structured and cyclical economies truly started with dawn of the industrial age. In comparison to the history of human civilisation, all of this is still quite recent though that does not mean we can or even afford to lose momentum due the problem in front of us like climate change but not only that. Everything is nature including us, everything that we do but to think we are directing the course of anything or protecting something is thinking too much of ourselves—> have you tried stopping time? 

What is an economy? It’s multiple trade systems participating with each other in a monetary system primarily BASED and made to serve various requirements of human beings. For example, what would be an economy of a nation state without any population? If there is no demand then what is the need for supply for anything? A business can not build and sell on to itself. Netflix works because of the audience. iPhones are being used by real breathing people. Video games are popular among players. YouTube has an audience. Amazon has consumers. Jio has customers using SIM cards. Air India has passengers. Taj Mahal hotel hosts tourists and travellers. X / Instagram has users. Spotify has listeners. So on…all because of humans. 

Capitalist economies are not spread evenly or fairly across the whole for both good and bad reasons but that does not mean they can sustain without people and for what? Again, it’s important to remember that economic structures came out of the need of the people to coordinate and not the other way around.

Everything is inter connected to everything else based on needs and wants of human beings. To say any business can sustain or have even a cent worth of value without catering to human beings in some way, shape or form is saying that a tree can eat its own fruits. But that is not the case, as we know extremely well—> apples fall from the trees. That is not even a perfect analogy in this case but you get the point…i guess?

If people won’t have jobs, if the consumer won’t have the purchasing power then who will the businesses sell to? How would they price things? Sure, things kinda got out of hands in terms of greed but we still have a good thing going here which will keep getting better with right use and better technology.

It’s fun to work with other people, interact with clients, to turn strangers into friends, even after you have all kinds of securities, that is still a source of joy to keep going. I personally struggled with that question a while back thinking why am I doing what I am doing whether is making movies or building products—> the answer was to share with other people and it improved all my work.

Current AI tools have immense scientific use case other than being useful for coding + related functions but are yet to become really useful products for everyday consumers. Productivity does not mean less work, it means getting more done with better quality as our efforts have better equity with thought and more agency with time = more opportunities.

The future potential is abundance minus unnecessary friction for everyone on the planet without depleting the limited resources here on earth and AI is vital in fulfilling that promise. It’s software getting better which should not be confused with anything else because of hype or hysteria.

Technical answer for properly tackling the challenges of AI are again evolving protocols. Not to say my solution is the only thing that will work, it might or might not but its progress in the right direction.

1. “Why aren’t you ever absolutely certain of your proposed solutions?”

—> I am certain of my convictions, and yet to be absolutely sure of any proposed technology based solution or product before practical implementation along with market testing would be misguidance and technically naive. It’s called start-up and not “surely-up” for a reason. 

Also, generally speaking—> Startups/ early stage ventures are not a matter of public opinion or unnecessary scrutiny, it isn’t supposed to make sense to just about anyone who knows nothing or has incomplete knowledge about the journey + micro or marco of the subject matter. Startups build products that are introduced to the public markets for judgement and tests.

1. “Would you be interested in participating in a startup accelerator?” 

—> Accelerators are amazing as conceived by Paul Graham and work for most startups in India, USA, UK and other countries. I encourage Startups to take that as priority route—> was also interested and even applied to few last year and another as fresh as some weeks ago. 

It’s not about having no interest in a startup accelerator, but it just does not suite the trajectory of this venture. Nothing personal with anyone who runs a cohort. I’ld love being part of a community of intelligent and honest people, without this startup being part of the cohort.

Accelerators are still welcome to have a conversation to directly invest in this venture.

8 A. “How are you going to get the startup started without joining a cohort or accelerator or some narrative?”

—> How about the good old “let’s stop beating around the bushes, put the narrative aside, cut the crap and come straight to the negotiation table?” 

That’s how I like doing business and it’s a pretty effective way. Though, I am open to grants or fellowships with money upfront to get started or to write the book.

Here’s my process if you want to give me a grant—> everything you want to know is already here—> you can contact me directly for specific queries—> then it’s up to you.

1. “It sounds dangerous to open source AI models because of all the risks involved besides not being a profitable strategy or an efficient framework.”

—> There are some misconceptions about open source and AI models out there. Most of the machine learning and computer vision projects, even the current most powerful models by Open AI and Deep Mind are fundamentally developed upon open source libraries like PyTorch and Keras Core. That’s just a fact. We are all building upon the life’s work of scientists and developers in this space as the only way to make progress in this field till recently was open source.

For clarity, this means any progress made by anyone in this space is an improvement upon open source research and development. It’s like plugging a 🍅 from a field to make a grilled cheese and tomato sandwich but refusing to water the plant or not feeding grass to the 🐮 for using its milk. It’s not cool. It’s like wanting eggs from a 🐓 without feeding it. We are promoting 🐈 values which are proprietary to cats because they are so cute rather than human values which should be greater though, also include 🐕 values.

Let’s be practical, you can keep the source code of your product closed as it takes significant resources to train current models and return on investment is a real thing but keeping the whole pipeline closed is not a long term growth policy.

Let’s be real, training large scale powerful AI models that can be of concern are only possible with a lot of💰and there are present guardrails on hardware already in place to prevent recluse behaviour.

It’s worth remembering, we are still extremely early in this whole thing to put research or development behind locked doors and the future in the hands of a select few. One constructive solution for AI development can be tangible open source + evolving protocols for efficient productivity to nurture RnD in science rather than relying on intangible ideals that can be taken for granted by greed or irrationality.

Like with everything else, I am open to different views as even though a serious and urgent topic, it’s not something to argument over based on idealisms in place of practical solutions.

1. “We don’t know enough about the project to invest at this stage. Are you trying to raise money based on vibes only?”

> “We should invest in people not ideas. A good idea is often destroyed by bad people and good people can always make a bad idea better.” ~[Simon Sinek](https://quotefancy.com/simon-sinek-quotes)
> 

Hah…no, not calling myself good or bad, though it’s true that you should invest in people and not in ideas. If you don’t believe in my abilities and skills then there’s no point working together, anyways. We can’t have AI Native Game Engine for you to invest in at pre seed stage, and it took deep research to even get to this hypothesis, all of which can’t be shared at this stage. 

By the way, there’s plenty of details available now about myself, and the project here on Notion. I am looking to make art and money, for anyone who’s interested.

1. “What’s a basic difference between your startup and 100’s of other AI startups with amazing track record building in this space?” 

—> We are upgrading automation to AI Native. There’s no AI Native tools or stack currently available for developers to build. 

Don’t have the specific text, though, think…Steve Jobs or Jony Ive spoke about how Apple builds software or hardware with the purpose of meeting end requirement for an individual—> this guides all of their design decisions. I have been using that little insight in doing almost everything.

1. “Why not build on GPT4, Claude, Llama or whatever model Google Deepmind is going to release? According to some controlled studies LLM’s are quite formidable and capable of many important tasks. It seems rather unwise to not build on readymade LLM’s or Multi Modals.”

—> Not building a chatbot. Based on extensive practical testing various AI text and voice chat bots, I advise people having conversations with other people, animals, trees, wind, water or themselves, rather than with a computer, at least for now. Tree is a word, but tree is also a living thing. You can train a vision model to learn 100 different types of trees and use LLM’s to articulate that knowledge with autoregressive next word prediction—> is that intelligence, though? It’s mostly labelling, classification and patterning without any emotional or thought construct from already available information relayed in context of imprecise prompts. FYI, I don’t have anything readymade which is better or worse other than having different requirements that makes it more viable to not build on readymade solutions.

1. A What is even the point of working in AI when Open AI backed by Microsoft is focused on building AGI? If not them then it’ll be Anthropic and Google Deep Mind is always there with the most talented people in the whole world. It needs massive investment to even exist in the same space, forget competing with them you puny scoundrel!”

—> Correct. . Not competing with anyone at this stage.

1. “Are you still working on AGI/ A?!/ ASI?”

—> No. Will update as we start developing and when something changes in this regard.

1. “Is this some kind of story app using generative AI to make videos?”

—> lol, no. There are already many wonderful Startups working on the product mentioned in the question. We don’t do FOMO stuff in this company.

- Additional Context
    
    FOMO full form—> ‘fear of missing out.’
    

1. “B2B or B2C”

—> The product is being made for individual use but enterprise can also find it useful.

1. “Does this project have anything to do with Crypto, Consumer Finance/ Fin Tech?”

—> No. Also, nothing to do with gambling, play to earn or financial services. This is only an AI native startup. However, this can be used to build Blockchain based or general Financial Services.

I would be doing a separate blockchain venture related to this [Dharma Initiative—> Not For Profit](../Side%20Ventures%20Projects%200ff66237567480838aa4ee58f9698b05/Untitled%2010066237567480a1bcf8d520bc67d477/Dharma%20Initiative%E2%80%94%20Not%20For%20Profit%2097750b859b02436ba13df447913d358a.md) in the future which might license tech from Path Integral or use the open source version.

1. “What’s the product domain?”

—> We will be building a game engine, thats the core product with extensions in multiple domains. If you don’t realise that gaming industry itself needs to level up and that will be useful in other domains then I have nothing to say to you! 🎮 

Re think scope of a gaming engine and we will also be building a wearable device in SOLO.

1. “Why are you in such hurry?”

—> Why are you not?! We have a roadmap, and need to start now to implement it.

1. “What is CitizenAI?”

—> AI can be used to build more transparent and better governance models rather than only being deployed at interface or application or media layer. CitizenAI open source project will be a head start for anyone wanting to build in that realm. We will have protection layers to make sure it’s all transparent and only developed in public.

1. “We would like to get clarity on a few issues.”

—> You are requested to kindly follow these [guidelines](../Path%20Integral%E2%80%94%20AI%20Native%20Game%20Engine%20d5c888bb53304b80b1faa8feb852cb7e.md) to make direct contact for absolute clarity.

1. “What makes you so excited about building AI first product in the mentioned domains and what do you bring to it?”

—> It can be difficult for some people to grasp, but along with technical familiarity with the technology and science of AI, I primarily bring a film directors essence to every subject—> which is not generally appreciated because there’s nothing general about it, that’s how I approach everything. The wonderful things we will be able to build with AI to share with the world is truly exciting.

1. “What are you doing in btw, till this Startup gets going?”

—> Continuing with reading, thinking and writing, generally + about topics based around AI + tech in limited capacity as the technical details of the venture are stealth. Also, managing my own social media with the purpose of promoting this startup and the book along with other work related opportunities, which is a full time job for many people + organisations and a lot of hard work reading, liking content day/ night. 

For sure, this kind of AI Startups usually take a different route to attract investors, but who says we need to do things based on a template? I was really tired of doing everything in stealth when developing movie scripts, it’s better to be out there in terms of the approach, and let people approach us, rather than the other way around. As mentioned, actual details are still stealth—> but, ancillary work and myself are open + approachable.

You can’t do all this inside a vacuum either, therefore, quite natural to talk about current or not so current things. Since, I do everything with complete dedication and focus, it’s a 24x7 mission to accelerate.

1. “Doesn’t your idea need market validation? You aren’t special, you know?!”

—> Products need market validation. Ideas need to be built. Also, a technical product is different from a product based on innovating mechanics of trade. For example, there’s little point in extensively brain storming sales and marketing strategy for an electric car if you have not already built an electric car and before anyone asks—> no, we are not building electric cars.

1. “Aren’t you tired of writing FAQ’s?”

—> Yes, totally, but you gotta do what you gotta do! I don’t like writing FAQ’s, therefore, it’s a lot of hardwork.

1. “What could be the reason for some people underestimating and other overestimating AI capabilities?”

—> It’s a side effect of the Information age, facts get lost among opinions because only few can profit from facts whilst many do from opinions—> a negative but also a positive 🤷‍♂️

iPhone/ Smart Phone is like the sub era of the Information age, many things came together in the app ecosystem which based on variable proximity to an actual solution leads to different estimations by experts or non experts.

AI is peculiar as being an expert in making apps does not makes you an expert in the science to make AI first products by default which is not a dig on anyone.

1. “You think philosophy can be useful in building AI first products? Ha…..ha…ha”

—> That’s a midwit take. All products started as logical “philosophies”, and you might be using one right now. It depends whether someone is positioned to build it into a product or let others take advantage, sometimes you have to get yourself in position.

No subject/ branch of knowledge exists in a vacuum of its own even if it once did in the early days of science. Also, it depends on the background and skilzs of the person approaching a problem to bring different pieces together for building useful products. We can’t have ready made solutions for anything not made out of readymade solutions, therefore, the most important research skill is objectively looking for a solution.

1. “Why don’t you build something to solve a real problem?”

—> Let me give you a classic example about this issue to drive the point home and it’s called the iPhone, that also inspired Android smart phones. Almost every consumer facing technology today is running as an app through a smart phone. In turn spiralling into multi million or billion dollar businesses themselves, Uber for example was not predicted when Steve Jobs launched the thing in 2007.

Air India started as a fun project because JRD Tata was interested in flying planes and became one of the primary airlines of the world. Most development in computer science has been led by gaming enthusiasts and so on. Flying human beings was classified as not being a real problem back in the early 1900’s but how much of the business and activities does it drive around the world? It’s difficult to think about a world without airplanes. Satellites orbiting around earth was a science fiction concept at first before it became a reality, now helping solve all kinds of problems in various important domains including communication and agriculture.

There are several examples of technologies or projects starting as fun which did not seem like a serious problem at the time but ended up solving real problems or opening new avenues for the general pubic. Compare that to businesses that are started with the propaganda of solving serious problems to secure funding or valuation or status though end up solving absolutely nothing but also being actually funny.

1. “What are your thought re use of AI in military applications?”

—> We will be building AI native weapons for special use cases only.

But also read this—> The following is said in the context of my personal views which are based in unconditional peace for all of humanity and does not necessarily or fully reflect my general + professional understanding of geo politics. This is also not any kind of statement on history. Already wrote about the risk of AI here [“But many important people are worried about AI being a major threat.” I would like to keep this brief and non technical because when so many people are wrong there’s money in the answer though, this FAQ is not exactly “lucrative” —>](ANNA%20+%20SOLO%20FAQ%20ed09f44607894d988c39d3c37c3a593f.md) 

Not having any wars or armed conflicts would be so much better but we don’t live in an ideal world. I don’t have deep understanding of defence sector / domain and have no interest in violent conflicts either, though, publicly available information suggests various countries developing automated weapon systems—> auto pilot in Air Planes has been available forever but still not perfect and still developing as the most mundane example. 

If the future is a bunch of non sentient robots squaring it off so that we don’t lose the brave soldiers anywhere on earth, well that sounds great. It always makes more sense to talk and figure things out, just saying that advancement in technology might lead us more towards that future 🤷‍♂️. The point here being about balance of power which is important to make diplomacy work and not a prediction or comment about defence requirements of any nation state. There are 8 billion people on earth with even more diversity if that could be counted in numbers, of course there will be conflicts and open minded flexibility is important/ vital to peacefully coexist but also to progress.

This is an extremely naive answer to this question because that’s the level of my personal disinterest in developing weapons of any kind. I love unconditional peace and diplomatic solutions—> more conferences, festivals, conventions and less wars! 🤍

1. “What do you think of Quantum Computing? Also, do you want to transition to that?”

If anyone understands Quantum Physics as much as anyone can + basic computing to high end use cases then it’s pretty self explanatory. I have read few research papers and a bunch of blogs though have never actually come across or used an actual working or non working quantum computer. Therefore, it would be pretty naive to comment as computers are supposed to work in practice, not in theory—> at the moment its like someone has put a quantum car together attached to magic horses though it’s anyones guess if they are going to be pulling it or not?! Quite early, i am not worried of being left behind in the quest to own a quantum computer or anything like that. To be honest, I am not worried of being left behind in anything other than love and kindness.

Sure. Though, transition to quantum computing does not keeps me awake at night and is not really part of any specific plans. I mean…..’we will see what happens’ is the most sensible thing to say in this regard. I can’t even buy a candy right now of my own, you know?

Rough plan is to build the product, start generating revenue and then analyse.

1. “Out of 🍦 or 🎮 what do you want to do first?”

—> Simultaneously, because they are inter dependent. The “plan” with the startup is to begin lean + small rather than spending boat loads of money which means having the flexibility to onboard investors who align with the long term vision while achieving short term product and sales goals. This would also leave enough room to complete the book and have a personal life. It’s important to control our own pace as a startup, rather than being unnecessarily pushed around.

30 A. “What’s the The Grand Loop book about? Will anyone able to read it to make their own AI?”

—> Contents of the book have nothing to do with building AI, specifically. As such, this is not your typical AI book concerning “the brain with the machine” but to take you on a trip of a lifetime. Useful in more ways than you can imagine before reading or playing 😅

30 B. “Aren’t you trying to do many things? Should focus on one thing.”

—> That’s topic of the day thinking without knowing the subject. The 🍦 and 🎮 are the only two things being worked upon to start, both are separate but connected in essence that one is relaxing exercise for the mind, which on a given day could be either. Focus is not sitting and looking at the needle but the ability to move it. Go back to the school kids. Also, welcome to The Hitch Hikers Guide To The Galaxy, if you don’t get the reference [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy)

1. “AI is a sensitive topic with lot of Geo Politics involved. What are your views about this? Also, explain your position re China”

—> I have no geo political interests, personally or professionally. That would be really funny if I did. I have been following multiple governments to understand their current governance models from Japan to Argentina, and how it will affect their future AI policies. It’s important to follow global political discourse as there’s a lot of misinformation re AI policy, one nation’s or union’s policy can effect others. AI is also related to every domain in the world whether financial trade or movement of goods, you have to keep a wide and broad view to construct business models. Again, it’s more to be future ready when we have to deal with such issues in practical capacity for sales.

In case of any conflict between India and China/ any other south Asian Country, i will only hope for a peaceful resolution with good trad ties, though, would always take 🇮🇳 India’s side. That’s not a debate.

Personally or professionally I will follow the foreign policies and advice of resident country most likely to be USA, India, UK, Europe or UAE. Whether it’s AI or otherwise. 

China has a communist political system which really bothers me and I don’t see myself ever living there. Had been intrigued for the purpose of writing fiction but that was also to highlight its position in the world economics while still being somewhat of a secretive culture. I respect the people of all countries including China and want to provide no further thoughts on its politics as it’s none of my business.

In full transparency—> I had a business partner who is originally from Mumbai, India but **was** based in Beijing, China along with his wife. Though, he came back to India when the pandemic started. Him being my business partner was a co incidence as we used to work together for an American VFX company in Mumbai, India 2007-2008. It’s funny to call him my business partner as we never had any transaction or monetary exchange. I have never travelled or lived in China personally either. 

Other story was loosely based on an article published in some Indian News Paper about a Cab Driver making fool out of an American Tourist by telling him that it’s a civil war in the city for extra fare. I took that basic premise and tried to build the whole world around by including probability theories and whatnot. I always want to tell stories that can have a global appeal, therefore, tried to base that story in Beijing playing on the Hollywood — China dynamics in context of a driver being able to make fool of a tourist due to unfamiliarity with with the local language. The whole film was based in a car, though, in India majority of digital + physical communication is in English so it didn’t seem like a viable story unless the protagonist was a total fool. Also, there was a lot of funding available at that time from Chinese film companies and everyone in the world was going for it. But ended up writing a draft based in Mumbai. No one bought the screen play, it never went anywhere much but you never know, once you do well things change and old stuff can get picked up.

I wrote a fiction screenplay in 2011 which had Chinese people as characters in India or New York depending on the draft, based on information collected from Google search results or facebook posts or general internet. The story was to highlight privacy concerns with tech being part of our everyday life and China’s dominance in electronic manufacturing leading into digital and putting them in a position to take unfair advantage. Which we can see playing out with TikTok. I can’t advocate for anything to be banned in good conscience but don’t care and can’t be bothered with Geo politics.

    Heard chatter on some corner of the Internet about trolls trying to decipher people’s ideology based on the colours or figuratively anything interacted with on a daily life—> it’s complete idioticness and arguments of absolute fools. There are limited colours in the spectrum which are used everywhere and an individual has no control over how a brand chooses to represents themselves. What can you do? Go around asking people to change colours all around so that idiots looking to make a buck by spreading rumours can be satisfied?! Anyone choosing brand colours to represent an ideology is stupid with corrosive intentions. I don’t choose colours based on ideology of anything but for the natural feel and ART of it. Not a debate.
    

1. “Are you building Virtual Reality or Augmented Reality based product?”

—> NO. Not making a product focused on either Virtual or Augmented Reality. Might venture into Augmented Reality at some point in the future though too early to claim anything like this. 

Everyone developing Virtual or Mixed reality is doing important work, especially the hardware as that still needs lot of development so that anyone can use a headset/ glasses/ eye contraption like a smart phone or a laptop.

Don’t think Augmented Reality is as simplistic as making nice glasses with the best features. AR + AI would make human interaction with the digital world much more natural—> My basic principle of developing augmented reality is immersive + indulging without the intrusiveness of always wearing glasses or putting on a headset which is not easy at all in terms of both hardware + software.

1. “You should get a Co Founder?”

—> Sure, I can go to the markets and just buy one…..eh?

while its good if this happens to be the case, it should not be a forced connection. Having a co founder is like finding a life partner, over engineering doesn’t lead to great results, especially in terms of the start up. It’s better to elevate early employees to a co founder annotation if that helps to accelerate and make best use of time. Investors would love this as it mitigates risk by not putting all their chips on a solo founder—> template/formulaic thinking can be useful in generalised cases, though not always.

1. “There will be a board of directors, of course?”

—> Yes, thats fine. We can discuss and figure out a structure that works.

1. “You have no professional experience in building AI first products. We would rather prefer to invest in those who have worked for Apple or Google or Microsoft or Tesla or Meta or some other tech giant.”

—> No one has experience building a truly AI first products but everyone is trying to do their best. Just saying. Many people have vast experiences in machine learning or computer vision which is great and am looking forward to working with those people in this startup. If everyone has similar experience, style or capacity of learning then we will end up with same things while innovation breeds from a slightly different point of view. I have confidence in my technical research logic and execution based on logic which also prevents overconfidence. That’s why not jumping into something completely left field like healthcare, but motivated by interest in gaming and the potential to eventually/ hopefully have a positive impact on other fields.

1. “Where do you want the company to be based out of?”

—> Ideally? It’s important to be primarily based out of a free market with political alignment and least amount of political, religious or general fanaticism to save time and focus on the work.…..also in terms of access to Capital, tech + talent from all around the world.  

Maybe, New York, New York 🗽 or SF 🇺🇸 or Netherlands 🇳🇱 or Singapore or Scotland or Japan. Heard that Canada is looking for an edge over its dominant neighbour? I am open to anyone who wants to invest and meet the deal terms.

Happy to receive unsanctioned monies from Russian Oligarchs for startup pre seed. St Petersburg or Moscow are also potential starting points if the war is over.

I don’t see language being a barrier to collaborate, as almost seamless  translations even with the prototype of the headband we are going to build is possible.

Do read the roadmap to get 

started and get ahead. I see market for this being bigger than smart phones, so eventually we’ll be everywhere.

36 A. Why not start this up in India🇮🇳 itself?

—> I tried to raise funds in India initially right after the pivot as well to no use. If this was a startup focused primarily on the consumer market from the onset, then it would make sense to be based in India. However, that is not the case at this time, and there are other concerns which can not be mentioned here. This is not about nationalism, but positioning—> Building the base out of a location we can start immediately, then expanding from there to other places is a viable and necessary approach.

I am born and raised in India, and by default have an unbreakable connection, it’s difficult to say anything without raising a cent, but we might have a second office here in the future. 

36 B. Is it because you are not a Nationalist?

—> What does my work has to do with that notation? No one judged Sundar Pichai or Satya Nadella for joining Google and Microsoft respectively or million of other examples. That’s just a cheap politically motivated point. I don’t work for the government in any capacity and never have, and as a private resident I should have the liberty to pursue interests globally without restraint including ability to travel, move or start ventures in other countries. Someone could accuse me of not having Indian people’s interest if I don’t invest in the country after making money—> which is not the case as I have definite plans of setting up this [Dharma Initiative—> Not For Profit](../Side%20Ventures%20Projects%200ff66237567480838aa4ee58f9698b05/Untitled%2010066237567480a1bcf8d520bc67d477/Dharma%20Initiative%E2%80%94%20Not%20For%20Profit%2097750b859b02436ba13df447913d358a.md) in India from origin. It won’t be too far into the future.

As latest as Nov 2023, I wrote to a LinkedIn Connections, previously working at The Tata Opportunities Fund and still on board of Tata Companies, but he had moved on from that position. Around 2010-2011 I was in touch with Tata ELXSI, though couldn’t resurface those connections and they likely didn’t have anything to do with investments. Still, I even tried getting in touch with Mr. Ratan Tata himself in March 2024 via Social media to no use. Something I learned in all these years is that I can only have people of ethics on my team.

Apparently, under Modi you need to convince one of his cronies rather than raise funds for your startup based on insights and technical hypothesis. It’s not possible to build AI Native in such narrow minded political or business environment. This was not any different under rule of other parties either.

![IMG_1384.jpeg](ANNA%20+%20SOLO%20FAQ%20ed09f44607894d988c39d3c37c3a593f/IMG_1384.jpeg)

I had some connection with a film company funded by Mr. Anand Mahindra’s family office from previous business development attempts, they likely won’t have made any recommendations and there was no other way to connect to seek venture investment. I still tried getting in touch on social media in Jan 2023.

It’s unlikely that anyone in India with risk taking capacity will take risk on a tech startup thats not market oriented from the onset even for a field as exotic as Artificial Intelligence and west has a better venture capital environment to build such ventures anyway, though silicone valley is rampant with protectionism these days. Russia is sanctioned, though still a wild card. If Britain can emerge out of own ass then maybe there.

If anything, my success anywhere will add to India’s soft and hard power—> thats the non political + rational way of looking at this. In fact, all people should be looked upon and treated from a non political view point.

My first paid gigs playing cricket and doing theatre were in Delhi, my first job was in Mumbai for a branch of an American company after doing a Diploma course from MAAC. From 2013 to this day I have been working from India and associated with many Indian businesses.

This hypothetical question does not even make any sense. But still if someone senseless raises such an idiotic baseless concern—> My choices are based on progress and not anything else like politics.

    I love public dealings, but not dealing with fanatic idiots because you can not reason with such people. Also, most fanatics are hypocrites controlled by those with power or money. It’s just total waste of time and energy. There are all types of people everywhere, you can reason with intelligent people or waste time with those you can’t reasoned with at all. I want to be able to reason with those working with or around me, rather those who can be manipulated by just about anything.
    

36 C. “Won’t it be better to be based out of a less expensive place?”

—> All major cities in the world are expensive in a similar range. Focus, peace, resources, flexibility and best performance are more important. We can be registered anywhere based on capital and resources.

36 D. “When do you want to start and move to 🇺🇸?”

—> Now. Looking to start Immediately whenever you are reading this. This was written on date—> 15/10/2024 and will be updated if situation changes.

1. “What is the one thing you expect if someone wants to work with you?”

—> HONESTY AND TRANSPARENCY. That is the foundation of good communication.

1. “Is there some expectation of privileged treatment.”

—> How come? Not asking for a private jet or helicopter to fly me to NYC or from there to anywhere else or a condo on the top floor of The Empire State Building or Bhurj Khalifa or insert name of the city you like. Reading what you want to read because it suits a certain narrative is an age old problem with cynical and pessimistic people. 

I had mentioned risk of AI disinformation being a problem in Nov 2022 based on research along with probable measures as much as I could share for free on social media. 

To startup or write a book or any work or performance is not a privilege or a trophy but a responsibility to deliver unless you are in a crony professional culture. The whole point of a startup is orientation to results compared to any other form of academic setup and being cent/paisa/penny to cent/paisa/penny productive. 

Among major concerns of academic or corporate institutions should be to not become like a political party because they have a different arena to play and those dynamics are best suited in there.

“But there are PHD’s entitled to find progress or breakthroughs.”

Start your own start up then, who’s stopping them?! These guys did—> [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google)

But if you want comfort of an established institution where results don’t really matter that much though managing expectations or getting enraged then nothing wrong with that either. I get it, it’s totally fine. You do you, I do whatever the heck I like. That is not to say my way is better or worse but with an intention to deliver. Stop being so rigid in your thinking, practicing flexibility rather than judgement is a real moat.

Last thing I think of doing on any given day is discouraging someone from doing anything, especially when they seem to be good + passionate. Therefore, I don’t get all the talk down mentality.

Don’t care if anyone thinks doing what you are good at and getting paid for that is a privilege because they could never believe in themselves. Keep it real 🥂

1. “Define early adopters for this product.”

—> Read the rough roadmap above. Early adapters will be game and AI developers, either individuals or organisations. 

We will also have Open Source version to get people started.

1. “You will be directly competing with well established products like Unreal Engine and Unity among many other open source options.”

—> We can compete based on engineering and design in this product category. The work is cut out and going to be difficult though if we can build a product that’s exponentially better at building games then strategy and politics of getting to the market are relatively easier concerns.

40 A. There are startups and incumbents already building games with AI Models.”

—> We are not a gaming startup, but an AI startup. Those models are again largely data automation. It’s a beautiful thing about science that you can always engineer better products and that’s why we are in this game. You need to rethink scope of a game engine when you think about ANNA.

1. “Why is the product called ANNA?”

—> It’s the name of my favourite artist and person Anna Chukova, apart from being a palindrome, so that’s already awesome in every way possible! Also, ‘Artificial Neural Network A………”

1. “What’s your believability of seeking trust to build this while basically being a loser?”

—> I have been working on this problem since 2011 while constantly upgrading myself without giving up. Even before getting into VFX, i wanted to build games so it’s not something completely random. To some pompous jerk that might seem like loosing, to me it’s always felt like preparing. Started with interest in spatial computing/ AR and you can read everything on the pages here to gauge the research based insights on AI. 

Also, I am building something extremely difficult, but practical that can be iterated on rather than proposing something that can be “quickly popular” for market effect. Therefore, I don’t really understand the “grab and run” kinda diagnosis which seems rather unfair, far fetched and absolutely silly—> anyone with such concerns is not only mistaken, but is also a bad judge of character or spreading deliberate malice.

Same with the book—> I never wanted to write a book, thats a completely different ball game from writing movie scripts or essays, and i was not much of an essay writer either till recently. Like everything else, I take upon projects based on curiosity and interest, felt this is something that can be shared with the world and needs to be in a book format to begin with and develop further into other formats.

I have another couple of idea for fiction books ‘Learning to Laugh’ and “Gangs of Influencers” which is much more easier, but not pushing at this time because🍦makes more commercial sense.

1. “Would you consider doing something else and wait on this to start in a while?”

—> No. Why would I do that? That makes no sense at all. I don’t make any decision lightly or without considerable amount of thinking from every possible angle. I am unemployable, not because I can’t do anything else, but because this is what I can do best, so, why shouldn’t I do the best possible thing? Both the book and building the game engine are exciting projects, there’s no reason to delay either. Ready to START.

1. “Sure you don’t have the money, but why don’t you have a hamster schedule?”

—> Because you should only keep an hamster schedule when you are trying to accomplish something that can be achieved by keeping a hamster like schedule. Otherwise, you are unnecessarily restricting your thought process into an hamster pattern that is useful for accomplishing only certain types of tasks while leaving you unprepared for deep thinking scientific or artistic work. It’s never about accomplishing the schedule but accomplishing the task. For example—> to ideate a piece of fiction or doing deep logical work you don’t necessarily need to sit in a place constantly. But when you are done with the rough work and ready to implement with the resources than minimum 8 hours a day become essential, if you are truly motivated with a burning passion than it looks more like 18 hours of custom + modular hamster schedule.

1. “You post so much stuff on social media without any traction, do you want to become an influencer?”

—> I don’t mind a stream of revenue till we can get started with this venture and then manage on the side. Though, it’s not so much about becoming an “influencer” but to keep sharing mindfulness and insights to help the people + also helping them build a better understanding of associated subjects.

1. “Are you building a content business rather than a tech business or both? It’s bound to fail!”

—> We will be building as advertised. What do you do with a game engine if not build games?! Unreal Engine was made to build Unreal Tournament and so on. John Carmack started with the intention of building a game and not a game engine. We are not building Pixar because there’s more long term commercial sense in building the tech while it made sense for Pixar to sell the movies. Calm down.

1. “Considering you have no money, will you use the money invested in the company primarily for personal use?”

—> Sorry?! Even though the project is named Anna, the money is being raised to build the game engine and not for my wedding. lol. If you are a professional investor then you know how this works—> all the cards can’t be in your pocket.

It’s a long term project with incremental goals. I can do 1000000 things like raising a venture fund to invest in startups or only writing the book and becoming an influencer while doing other stuff for an easy life, but I like challenges, and have put in last 2 years doing specific research on these subjects other than doing AI soft research for several years prior. That does not mean I want to live hand to mouth for satisfaction of someone’s perception about “how a startup founder should conduct his personal life.” It says nowhere that eating only once a day will make the game engine better than if my family eats 3 times a day or however my lifestyle looks like.

Such naive rubbish is for the non curious, non intelligent or non objective. I am only addressing this because internet is filled with such low level concerns of investors who care more about perception than the product when it’s all about keeping the balance.

Neither the startup or the book are vehicles to drive “my personal brand.” Not that kind of startup, I am not that person, if you have that perception and you don’t directly communicate to correct yourself then you are not the person I want to work with either. No denying, these projects will contribute towards ‘the personal brand’ aspect if found helpful and useful by people, but you also have to respect the massive risk factor involved.

It’s not even like “oh it’s a shiny new thing daddy will help fund.” It has never been that easy and thank goodness!

    I love Anna Chukova, and want to spend my life with her, still a real person who also does not have vast or any resources, rather than choosing to “marrying well for the money.” Don’t really see or understand whats the scam?!
    

1. “What would be the core improvement and impact of your product?”

—> Stealth. Talk to me.

1. “We are a black box with huge investment to manufacture semiconductors in a country previously not known to build any but it will take time to get going so we want to wait before engaging or making investments in startups, if any. I am also 86 years old with not many great advisors around me when it comes to tech or startups. What should I do under these circumstances?”

—> Time is an illusion sir and we don’t have any. You cannot wait for this to start, that to finish…thats precious time wasted which could be used in actual product development and relevant feedback loops rather than deliberating about the righteousness of things. Parallel development, thinking and computing are all highly effective techniques that are need of the hour not only in computing but also in decision making. How things look should be the least of your concerns compared to how things might turn out in case right decisions are not made at the right time including valuing other people’s time. Your investment in this could strengthen your position in the semi conductor side of things while not indulging with this is a slope easily projected on its usual trajectory. 

1. “Explain the risk to tech consultancies, please.” 

—> As you would know, most of the tech consultancies are built upon engineering talent and proven track record of implementing solutions at scale, made on third party software and infra rather than core tech competencies. 

It’s a servicing business more like Advertisement agencies rather than tech companies and that means fragile to change, dependent upon retention of skilled talent and client looking for safety rather than adventure like Banks or Railways while always chasing to integrate foundational technologies that others are building. Even the websites of some known tech consultancies won’t get approval from me, even for a low paying client, it’s all buzz words and template designs executed like an after thought rather than serving useful function.

The client limited in their understanding of tech is looking for a reliable name to off load the responsibility in case shit hits the roof, internal management have a marketable name to blame—> “we chose this vendor because of their 30 years of work in this domain” or someone who can always send more manpower to stabilise a vulnerable situation. I kinda grew up around tech servicing business and then worked most of my life in that even when not being paid well lol…to understand the fundamentals inside out!

Tech consultancies neither have the talent or the bandwidth or organised for the kind of research required to compete with companies like Open AI or Anthropic or Google or Tesla in their domain. Sure, you can use compatible open source solutions but engineering hacks are not going to make much difference when your foundation model can’t compete with the best. 

It’s not only about automating engineering but fundamental change in your relationship with software itself and like everything else, comes down to cost. It will no longer be like “everyone is building on this stack” or “how much more you can get out of C++ or python even if you are an OG coder.” Your code dependencies are going to be much larger on AI providers like Open AI/ Microsoft or Tesla for self driving cars than lets say Autodesk for use of their software. Let’s not even get started with complexities of Data acquisition. 

Large consultancies will have smaller advantages which would lead to break away teams or new consultancies or better equipped internal teams altogether offering similar solutions to previously susceptible clients—> thats just talking short term like what can happen in 10 years. Hiring talent will also change as much as servicing clients. Tech consultancies much like the advertisement industry might ultimately become a game of Mergers & acquisitions.

Based on the above, we can ascertain that an empire largely based on market value of a consultancy is vulnerable and at risk in the long term. Unless, you invest in developing core competencies in AI which can’t be done under the organisational structure of a consultancy, therefore—> startups.

It’s one thing to be a manufacturing facility for semi conductors and another to compete with ASML or Nvidia, you probably can’t. You are competing on location value which is highly susceptible to Geo politics. More and more affordable locations with low cost labour will be coming up other than India, like Mexico or Indonesia in the present and Africa in the near future. Therefore, other than being vulnerable to political upheaval, margins are low there as well even with a growing local market. It’s more long term survival than thriving.

For example—> if you are wholly dependent upon a previous operation in another country to teach you how to achieve compatible performance as a manufacturing unit for a well paying global client, thats a pretty low bar for internal RnD competency.

1. “The truth of the matter is that people will keep saying they are interested and posting inspiring gibberish, but rather invest in someone who has worked for Google or Microsoft even if they have not contributed anything worthwhile or they have maybe or someone with no clue but an ass kisser with enough to make it “look good.” The point is most VC’s are not sure of themselves to take an actual risk of reputation or money, their curiosity is limited to their insecurities. How will you navigate this problem?!“

—> this is tough. I can’t do much in this case other than what I have been doing. There are many concerns about just putting the work out there without any incentives and if you could make this without any money then why would I even want VC money?! It’s not a trophy or a gold medal to take investment from someone but a grave liability and a risk itself because you never know about their intentions, the venture could suffer because of bad investors, more than bad employees because you can always fire someone who works for you and its really complicated to fire an investor at any stage but especially at pre seed or seed stages. It’s mostly about connecting with someone sensible and my email is open for direct communication.

That’s another reason I am raising a really balanced figure with solid built in incentives. Once, we are out there with some form of the intended product then it won’t be a problem to raise money from insecure and unsure investors either.

1. “Why don’t you just start building in open source itself and things will work out on their own, they always do! It’s like a movie!”

—> It’s nothing like a movie. Building an AI first game engine is not your usual computer science curry that can come together with a community hard at it. We are also not building some communal IT park where the whole point is to bring in more crowd. Those are not the recipes that work in this case. Everything has its own patterns and organisational principles, it’s better to start in stealth and then open source it at the right time + stage. There’s plenty of evidence out there of projects starting open source from origin and not on the best of trajectories as we speak, it’s fine they tried and learned, but I am not here to knowingly repeat other people’s errors. I read to get better and have a better plan.

1. “What incentive do human beings have in developing AI if it’s going to replace them at some point?”

—> AI is never going to replace human beings, period—> I have a technical explanation for this thesis which I am happy to share in exchange for money. 

Life on earth just like the rest of the universe is a not a static affair, if we don’t advance and adapt then we are as good as the dinosaurs. It might not be apparent if you analyse that from your narrow perspective but quite obvious from a multi perspective wide view over a lengthy timeline. Even with all the advances in tech, human race is still vulnerable to asteroids. Sure, we can try some things mostly for our own amusement but does current tech guarantee survival? Nope. Don’t look up.

What about climate change? Nope, we have no real answers as of yet other than macro economic, cultural or political posturing. Solar power is not replacing Oil, carbon levels are not reducing, temperatures will rise above 1.5 Celsius by 2050 as sure as tomorrow is Monday. It’s not for the lack of intention but lack of scientific solutions in every domain thats convincing enough for a general consensus to change. All you need to do is go talk to the corner shop, they don’t even believe climate change is a real threat or that plastic is bad—> I rest my case. Don’t look down.

Everything in the universe along with the universe itself is constantly moving and changing. Technological advances are not only about being fancy or earning big incentives which is just part of the process but survival over a long term period as a specie. It’s fine to not care about all this or to take it too seriously but at least don’t promote your negative mindset without reasonable arguments. Dream 🙂

1. “We are still not convinced. Can we see some lines of code?”

—> If you are not convinced, that’s totally your problem, not mine. There’s nothing I can do other than building as advertised here rather than do gymnastics to convince you that I can win boxing gold medal in the olympics.

If your argument is based in cynicism or pessimism to my actual insight on the subject matter then thats already a bad point to start a discussion.

In terms of the code, we need to get there unless you want to see the same code that every other gaming engine uses? or some hack of open source LLM’s? or some magic code that can do anything? Once we start building, there will be plenty of code and iterations. You are only repeating the set filtration pattern in your head which is not applicable in this case.

The whole world is apparently moving towards natural language programming because of developments in artificial intelligence but my insights in natural language are not enough for you to invest in an AI first game engine? What kind lousy argument is this? You should commission the 🍦 book so it can help you think better as a first order of business, maybe?

1. “How can you mitigate risks of an angel investor at this stage?

—> Based on all the factors + metrics 😉 —> Commission the book—>[The Grand Loop—> Book actively looking for a publisher](../Research%20+%20Book%20Projects%206cbd57a3aa79422f976215e5a528976d/Books%20100662375674800b9c0adcfb3982a189/The%20Grand%20Loop%E2%80%94%20Book%20actively%20looking%20for%20a%20publis%20205dae2c71c24f9dbad570b9001e99be.md) —> 50% of that will be automatically invested into building the game engine as angel investment.

You can earn both from sales of the book + equity in the venture initially as an angel investor.

The above deal is not a necessity or an ideal situation, its preferable to find separate deals with a publisher for the book and an angel investor for the game engine. 

However, the situation being what it is, combining both projects into one deal is to provide maximum available cushion for the incoming partners.

The idea of building the game based on The Grand Loop book is organic and not done from a financial perspective. That, in fact was the adjacent point which lead to putting together this proposed deal.

Happy to discuss a different or better deal.

1. “How did you got working on this project?”

—> I have been keeping up with the domain of AI for a long long time but never went into technical development myself until mid 2022 because of a job opportunity at Open AI recommended by a well wisher, but I didn’t get the job. However, I had hit a comfort level with the science of AI by reading and evaluating enough research papers to connect the dots in a meaningful way to give up. Maybe, it was years of accumulated insights on various subjects finding a specific purpose of being able to build something meaningful rather than just another app or service. It’s not about narratives like I was writing movies or side jobs as a glorified clerk or VFX Guy or technology consultant, therefore, it “looks awkward” to jump into this or that or the AI game—> The important thing being that I always kept my standards high and kept on learning. Narratives only matter in cinema or content and are forced upon people in reality. 

There’s a lot of diverse technical knowledge, you compound through each of those roles if looking to constantly improve rather than cashing out with every opportunity.

1. “What is an advantage of investing in this venture compared to investing in an applied AI SAAS Startups?”

—> You won’t be indirectly working for Microsoft or Google or AWS is a good enough reason. This is a stand alone project that won’t be dependent on legacy tech giants for them to pull the rug out without notification. Other than Deep Mind, most current useful foundation models have come out of the same cohort and that’s vulnerability of the ecosystem to be relied upon couple of entities for core development.

This is a profound question because unlike a programming language where you can show engineering chops to gain advantage in performance, developers are completely reliant on these models for output. Sure, you can use RAG’s and whatnot to stitch things together but with no real alternate options for output. It will look nothing like the saas business model.

How big is the market for fake media? Because thats pretty much where everything is headed for revenue and still a human being wanking at the other end, i guess one wanker at a time is how AI “takes over” the world?! It looks more like Only Fans take over of the world is imminent, i have never used it by the way 🤷🏾‍♂️

I like Satya, Bill and Steve Ballmer 😁 pubic personas as I don’t know them personally, but have to take some organisation as an example, what to do?! So, you think they will make an AI powered laptop and the AI on this laptop will direct you to an app made by a third party developer, by the way using the same AI model, rather than handling the query itself?! Sure, maybe take a course in capitalism and business models of big corporations while you are at it. Nothing like SAAS. AI Pin or Meta Glasses and obviously ‘Apple Watch’ have a better chance of competing.

When the foundation models are more AI and less automation, the data centre or no of GPU’s would matter based on the scale of the problem rather than needing 100 acres and 1 million GPU’s to output “Hello World.” That’s exaggeration but you get the point.

That’s the kind of solution we are building to make video games—> to see where iteration and output takes it.

Let’s say, a VC gives me two options—> 

Option 1. Startup with USD 1 million in my proposal of AI Native Game Engine Venture

Vs

Option 2. Startup with USD 10 million in their idea of an applied AI SAAS Venture

### I’ll gladly choose ‘Option 1’ on any given day or night.

- Additional Context
    
    Mind you, not looking to raise from one solo investor, could be 2 to 3—> in fact, thats preferred. Happy to talk to institutional investors as well, but it’s preferable if you are actively investing in tech or have previously invested in a known tech startup at any stage. 
    

1. “What device do you currently use, and how have you secured it?”

—> Currently, I do everything from an iPad 7 with a Logitech Keyboard connected via Bluetooth. Both were bought in 2020 during the pandemic to write and do usual digital tasks from anywhere. Have done nothing special to secure it other than using a VPN as general protection from common dangers on the internet/ Wi-Fi. There’s nothing special on it in terms of data, and would be absolute idioticness of anyone trying to waste their, and my time trying to hack it or steal stuff from it. Even though idiots everywhere are convinced about their wises. Whatever, knock yourself out. It’s easily hackable via Logitech Bluetooth, but I don’t have the money to buy apple keypad. Don’t know if it’s worth the use case either.

1. “Hypothetically, are you interested in any government job, for any government in the world?” 

—> I am definitely only interested in full time building this AI native game engine and writing the book. Like, what are we talking about? Happy to help governments as a consultant, but that’s pretty much it.

1. “Why do you want to build the SOLO head band prototype before anything else?”

—> While ANNA, AI native game engine will be our primary development tool, SOLO head band is the longterm consumer product vision. We want to evolve in that direction, rather than pivoting in the future. As a hardware tool, it’ll also be useful during internal development, keeping all data private, and senses focused + streamlined. I’ll be the solo user of the prototype head band under strict terms for both private and official work.

1. “AI startups are raising multi million dollars even at pre seed stage. What will you achieve by raising 1 million USD?“

—> We are building an AI Native Game Engine, and not focused or dependent on scaling the compute power, while most of the startups in this space raising massive rounds are reselling compute itself by repackaging/ rewrapping 3rd party LLM’s. Those building foundational models are focused on scaling for results, which requires them to raise massive amounts.

Path Integral would be a research led applied AI outfit, small in size, big in ambition. If we require more compute than we can afford, then we can always raise another round based on execution + performance or collaborate with any company already equipped with massive compute.

Also, we are raising only a small pre seed round of $1 Million, but will raise a Large Seed round based on the prototype.

[https://x.com/alexisohanian/status/1811090499068952744](https://x.com/alexisohanian/status/1811090499068952744)

“—> Alexis is right, and his thoughts serve as useful guidance. At first we’ll be building an AI native game engine, and plan to license it to developers. Being lead by research, and to have it as a core foundation of our product, so as to continuously improving, rather than engaging in corrosive or anti social competitive practices. While purpose of the research remains robust application, and improving the product for the clients.

1. “Are you interested in taking any kind of venture debt?”

—> NO. Private equity model is ideal and effective for startups.

1. “Aren’t you too old to do this?”

—> No. Is this a 100 meter race in the Olympics? Neither am I running for public office to soothe my ego with outdated ideology or useless ideas. Age is not a factor, I am only getting started.

1. “Hypothetically, If you raise $1 million at pre seed stage for let’s say 10% equity, your startup will have a valuation of $10 Million without even having a product. Some people are bonkers bothered about such things.” 

—> Thinking about valuations at pre seed stage is idiotic. The funds are not being raised for valuation, but to get started. Of course, its understandable that such valuation is completely theoretical, rather than being recognised by the markets of any actual value. As a founder, it’s the promise of the said product, the investors are putting the money towards—> for x10 or x100 or even more returns. If you don’t have an appetite for risk or you are devoid of curiosity, then invest your money into something else like real estate or just get into lending business, at the risk of being irrelevant. Plenty of people have lost their money in real estate as well, FYI.

Tech venture capital is a risky game, because in addition to the returns it’s also about curiosity—> not for everyone. Especially to invest in AI, emerging tech or contrarian bets is even riskier than a proven SAAS market which is only dependent on market capture with slight “innovations” and a clear track to accusation or IPO.

But, guess what?—> almost every product category gets disrupted by some emerging tech and better products by making riskier bets at early stage. While those looking for risk free returns laugh on such takes, and later suffer from FOMO. IYKYK.

Many investors are not even positioned to take such risks. So, the best they can do is to shut up or step aside rather than spreading pessimism by being naysayers. 

A founder being transparent, cognisant of all scenarios, flexible in their approach, and being able to take tough decisions is what investors can expect at best.

An investor realising their best chance at making that unprecedented return and filling the void of curiosity is only possible by enabling the founders to take their best shot at the problem on hand. Not everyone is capable of making a dent in the universe. Are you?

1. “In the previous startup attempt you started hiring people off the gate even when funding was not there. Why was that?”

—> It was supposed to be a virtual reality Edu Tech Startup, which meant making content. We needed educational content to build a platform. There was nothing as such new in terms of tech that we intended to build and only needed to keep stealth till there was enough content to launch. It was a crowded market for both edu tech and VR startups in those times, and is essential to know your competitive edge. Who makes content assets? People. Also, I was the only technical founder out of the 5, that lead to strange dynamics and team composition. So, hiring as a first step was the only way in that case. But, resources or funding were not made available as promised. Hence, those plans were cancelled without delay to avoid monetary burden or injury.

Edited 19/12/2024—> Also, I had shelved Rnd plans long before not because some other company already built similar kind of product, but because there was no scope of finding any development capital in India and then realised I couldn’t even build a product based startup with any of these people and pivoted to services as all of them were from marketing or sales backgrounds—> so they would stop wasting time and get orders, but even that didn’t pan out as we didn’t get any orders. You can read more about it in my essays titled “How not to startup.”

Every startup has a diverse journey based on the details, and it’s idiotic to compare startups in different domains.

1. “We don’t know, the narrative just does not seem believable for us to invest at this stage. This still feels like Theranos or SBF or The Royal Society”

—> Are you investing in a movie or a soap opera? If you have read this FAQ, all the promotion tweets, the essays and still believe there’s some “narrative malpractice” then you are either an idiot or fooling your own self. There’s no where it’s claimed that we are entitled like the Royals. 

Theranos said they were making a magic machine to generate blood test report from a drop of blood within minutes, I have not claimed any such things. Neither am I walking around in a turtle neck claiming to be reincarnation of Steve Jobs—> No. 

It’s repeatedly said that we are and will be focused on engineering based hypothesis—> abstractions—> iterations—> AI Native Products. Those who know anything about AI or computer science might already have picked up insights from all this. Someone with billions or even million invested in automation is not going to admit that I am right. Internet is a small place, if you don’t already know that.

AI Native is intelligent reasoning, and a lot goes into building machine intelligence for the benefit of humanity. If you thought that such an abstraction would come from established domain expertise then you need to think again. AI Native is the confluence of many different domains.

I am not into Effective Altruism or any such stupidity either. FTX was a hedge fund disguised as an exchange focused on making money via financial modelling which was not even taking crypto forward and this startup has nothing to do with crypto. It’s all core technical stuff + civilization scale thinking to make systematic sense. 

The condition to only raise funds from active tech VC’s who have previously invested in tech, if not in automation itself is a solid indicator of authenticity. The fact that we have an FAQ, it’s being pitched in public, but not raising public money is another sign of authenticity. The fact that we plan to generate early revenues from a game and game engine sales, other than releasing an open source version—> extremely tangible outputs which is quite opposite of being obscure. The fact that planned consumer device is a wearable computer is again extremely openly testable as a product. Being stealth at this pre seed stage is the only way to protect commercial interests and control the eventual quality, which has nothing to do with “secretness.” The humility to accept that even with all this we can fail is another indicator of authenticity to keep developing better understanding, rather than being burdened by over confidence. The fact that I have kept IPO aspirations at the 8 to 10 year mark when the hardware product should be in the consumer market is a good indication of authenticity in planning.

The fact that I post valid tidbits everyday on social media to attract a publisher for my book as a potential source of parallel income, rather than putting the burden of personal expenses on the startup is also authentic and wise.

The reason I have made my finances, other personal stuff public and post a lot on social media is because other than trying to establish a social media presence, I don’t want to hide or obscure anything from potential business partners, co workers and investors. As a film maker and writer i liked keeping a sense of “mysteriousness” which was ideal for that occupation, but as a founder + researcher of an AI startup, I don’t need to keep my personal life mysterious at all, and that’s unburdening on many levels to do the work of sales. As a startup founder, along with being all the other things, you are a sales person and a public personality from day zero by default, regardless of how many people know of you. “As salesmen you can’t be mysterious” ~ Bert Cooper to Don Draper of Mad Men, fictional characters can teach you a lot of important things 😉. 

1. “We are woke. Why should you get to do this?”

—> I am not “getting” to do anything. I can and will do this. You are confusing this with some crap movie Karan Johar would produce, that anyone can do mixed with socialist nonsense. AI Native is not a thing yet, no one is AI native—> neither deep mind, neither Open Ai, neither your “home brewed AI based branded chat assistant” and no one else. This is a low level question and discourse. I hope that’s well communicated, still this answer will not satisfy all the woke idiots which is ironic.

1. “What’s unlearning? Why would you need to unlearn anything. We think thats just a made up excuse.”

—> the question number is your answer in this case. If you understood unlearning, then you’ll truly understand learning. 

1. “You don’t want a job at a big tech startup or organization…but hypothetically would you be interested in taking investment in this startup from lets say Apple or Tesla/SpaceX/X or Amazon or Arm or Sony or Toyota or Nvidia or Intel or ASML?”

—> I don’t see any of these organisations investing at the pre seed stage, though if they were to invest then it’s the same roadmap. It’s more likely the CEO’s personal discretion to invest which can later lead to association with their company. Very interested in working with the Japanese...just saying. We will treat them like any other venture capitalist with maybe some specific deal terms based on the investment amount...like first look preference for the next round. This is for profit, all transparent about the scope and the method. Other than the actual IP, i like to keep everything open for all involved to analyse—> I won’t even mind the investors having complete ‘monitoring only’ of the startup’s bank account—> but, it has to be agreed upon, and not done behind the back. No room for second guessing or double meaning, and I expect the same. You get what you pay for. But that’s only for specific people, and not for a random tech or service provider.

We’re not looking to become an automobile or appliance company in the future, but I see everything including manufacturing being connect to the Solo headband, powered and running on ANNA’s AI Native code. So, when i mention Tesla or Toyota as potential investors, it’s not because we are building for automobiles only, it’s just one of the many ways to get started with a likely longterm partner.

Potential investors when thinking about the longterm scope should not ascertain this venture in the sense of a traditional business scaling through market capture based on political contacts among a crowded market with many suppliers having similar product looking to capture eyeballs. Even to think of the impact in the veins of SAAS business model would be a mistake as this would be more akin to the personal computer or mobile phones or the Industrial Revolution type of market movement or if you combine all of them together. This is all with an asterisk till we start building as I like to under promise and over deliver, rather than over promise and under deliver.

As a research engineer I can’t claim some product is going to work 100% unless it’s built and working, so the asterisk is not a reflection of the risk, but reality which is bound to change once we start building. Otherwise, I would be some idiotic politician giving useless guarantees. I expect other engineers and tech investors/ VC’s to understand this temporary position by default.

Or a job at somewhere like NASA?

Not interested. Open to them commissioning the book or investing in the startup like anyone else meeting the criteria. No offence, but we need to build a dynamic environment and culture which accelerates at building products for the consumer, not to satisfy a committee.
