Decentralised banking does not mean “no central banks”, of course there’ll still be central banks with even more auditing responsibilities along with better tools.

Decentralised Banking is not crypto banking. Blockchain is a developing science, and we are not even talking about meme coins. FYI.

Like mentioned earlier in this essay, this is supposed to be a technical document presented not only as an iteration of the current capitalism based economic models, but also to bring micro—> marco economics into a tangible and iterative technical framework. All aspects suggested in this document are subject to adaptability based on current positioning, and not to any ideology, movement or revolution.

Socialists are so desperate for attention and relevance that they would try to spin all conversations about building unbiased opportunity into arguments about “equal outcomes” and what not. 

How come colour red came to be associated with communists and socialist, but also the Republican Party? Science of colour is fascinating. One colour can represent multiple ideologies that chose it or nothing at all. Apples are not socialists, and they come in variety of colours.

Wokemindvirus is started by the socialist idiocracy, as they can’t think of anything other than narratives. What would a socialist space ship look like? It won’t, because it would only be a red coloured narrative and not an actual ship.

Socialist and cronies are conjoined twins as indirectly both disregard merit and evolution.

Any politician claiming their election or retaining power being the only crucial factor for a nation state’s economic stability or growth is him/her self a weak link to its economic model. As it reflects over reliance on the politics rather than on the skills and systems.

I am thinking about where to start in history to tell the story of capitalism, because it’s important to emphasise the need for its constant evolution as a system.

Human civilisations have been looking for ways to self manage even before we started inventing language. Even animals have ways to manage their groups, they are known as “rules of the jungle.” Language is a good point to understand the need for systems as something almost all human tribes felt the need to independently develop in some form or shape—> it’s not like, someone figured it out and sent a memo to every other human tribe on earth to develop their own languages. To develop language for communication seems to be an inherent conscious human realisation, just like the inherent need for economic systems to self manage small to large groups or to transact with other groups.

- Here is a brief overview of capitalism’s history according to ChatGPT—>
    
    ### Early Foundations
    
    - **Ancient and Medieval Roots**:
        - Trade and commerce existed in ancient civilizations (e.g., Mesopotamia, Greece, Rome).
        - Feudalism in medieval Europe laid groundwork with manorial economies and guilds.
    
    ### Emergence of Capitalism (15th-18th Century)
    
    - **15th Century**:
        - **Renaissance**: Growth of merchant capitalism, particularly in Italian city-states.
        - **Exploration and Colonization**: European nations began exploring, leading to global trade networks.
    - **16th Century**:
        - **Mercantilism**: European nations pursued economic policies to accumulate wealth through trade surplus.
        - **Enclosure Movement**: In England, land privatization led to a shift from feudal to market economies.
    - **17th Century**:
        - **Dutch Golden Age**: The Netherlands became a major commercial power, with innovations like the stock market.
    - **18th Century**:
        - **British Industrial Revolution**: Mechanization and factory systems revolutionized production and labor.
        - **Laissez-Faire Economics**: Adam Smith’s "The Wealth of Nations" (1776) advocated for free markets and minimal government intervention.
    
    ### Expansion of Capitalism (19th Century)
    
    - **Rise of Industrial Capitalism**:
        - Expansion of industries, urbanization, and labor markets in Europe and the U.S.
    - **Global Spread**:
        - Colonialism and imperialism spread capitalist systems globally, often exploiting colonies.
    - **Banking and Finance**:
        - Growth of financial institutions, stock markets, and corporate structures.
    
    ### 20th Century Developments
    
    - **Monopoly Capitalism**:
        - Emergence of large corporations and trusts in late 19th and early 20th centuries.
    - **Great Depression (1929)**:
        - Global economic collapse leading to increased government intervention in economies (e.g., New Deal in the U.S.).
    - **Post-WWII Capitalism**:
        - Keynesian economics influenced policies, with governments managing economies to avoid recessions.
        - Rise of consumer capitalism in the West; mass production and consumption.
    - **Cold War Era**:
        - Capitalism vs. Communism: Global ideological and economic struggle between the U.S. and Soviet Union.
    
    ### Late 20th Century to Present
    
    - **Neoliberalism (1980s-2000s)**:
        - Shift towards deregulation, privatization, and globalization under leaders like Reagan (U.S.) and Thatcher (U.K.).
    - **Globalization**:
        - Expansion of global markets, multinational corporations, and international trade agreements.
    - **Financial Crises**:
        - Major events like the 2008 Global Financial Crisis highlighted vulnerabilities in the global capitalist system.
    - **Technological Revolution**:
        - Rise of the digital economy, e-commerce, and tech giants like Amazon, Google, and Apple.
    
    ### 21st Century Challenges
    
    - **Inequality and Social Movements**:
        - Growing income inequality, debates on wealth distribution, and rise of movements advocating for economic justice.
    - **Environmental Concerns**:
        - Criticism of capitalism’s role in environmental degradation and climate change.
    - **Future of Work**:
        - Impact of automation, gig economy, and AI on labor markets and economic structures.
    
    This overview captures the broad evolution of capitalism, from its early roots to contemporary challenges.
    

I won’t be talking much about specific examples from history here, but about mechanisms and introduction to broad ideas. Don’t get testy while reading this, there’s room to explore all kinds of ideas and an effective system is one that based on requirements can incorporate any theory in practice.

It’s also of importance to note that the same system that works in a Tropical forest, does not necessarily works in a Temperate forest. However, Human beings are not trees either, we are not rooted to the ground, therefore, have greater flexibility to adapt. Even though every person is unique, we are more alike as a specie to each other, than different types of flora or fauna to their fellow species. Be considerate, if you are going to compare. 

The point being—> different human civilisations with diverse histories and complexities of power dynamics are not automatically going to adapt the best practical systems by default, but there’s a path for each tribe to optimisation. Even the tribes that have adapted to current best practices, would need to keep working at the first principles for optimal robustness.

There is no doubt in my mind that socialism as a system is ineffective, as it does not cater to the basic principles of demand or supply. But also, socialism does not inherits the human spirit of freedom and liberty. Communist socialism has been tried as an experiment in the past, and it failed every time. Such systems have never been about equality in practice even if that was the idea in theory, rather becoming tools of mass exploitation and manipulation being dependent upon top down power mechanics. Harsh truth is that aspiration of a utopian system, does not exactly translates into a utopia.

Democratic capitalism on the other hand has proven to be an effective system because not only it inherits the human spirit, but it also inherits the need for an important life mechanism known as evolution. This is not to say that current democratic capitalist systems are perfect, far from that, but the fact that we can talk, explore and realise the need for change is the most important dynamic of both democracies and capitalism.

There’s a hUge difference between ‘capitalist autocracies’ being run in the veil of a democratic system and an actual ‘democratic capitalist economy.’ Some would say, there’s no ideal democracies as each one of them can be classified at being on different panes of realisation, and that is not only true, but also better than being on a static pane of conformity by power of force or capital. While a ‘democratic capitalist’ system is bound to have a down cycle, like all the other distributed systems, down cycles of ‘autocratic capitalist’ or ‘communist socialism or capitalism’ usually look more like doom cycles because of the same dynamics which sustain them for short periods of time when measured on universal timescales.

Adapting temporary socialist techniques in a capitalist system to fill in the gaps is a completely different matter, and has proven to work in the short term with acute awareness of such implementations to effect change or transition, rather than dependence—> resulting in long term malpractice.

It’s not that I want to be “proven right” and that’s why I vouch for democratic capitalism, but I just don’t think any tribe on earth should go through doom cycles anymore, now that we have these mechanisms as recorded + factual knowledge. Wisdom is to act on knowledge, rather than to keep feeding our ignorance.

The above introduction is to establish the system I am going to be focusing on, rather than taking wild swings on everything. 

How can we put democratic capitalism on a path of evolution to make sure everyone within this type of system has equality of opportunity and sustainability? 

But also, how can we better handle the said down cycles of the current and future mechanisms in these systems?

This is a visualisation trying to provide an overview of the global financial markets by 2022. The numbers have changed since, like the advent of Nvidia, but the system is still the same.

Before we get back to the above—> hold this thought 1#

Let’s look at an example of how things change for the better with technology in a domain which has a history of adapting to change.

- Before the use of computers, the stock market operated in a much more manual, labor-intensive manner. Here's an overview of how it used to work:
    
    ### 1. **Trading Floors and Open Outcry System**:
    
    - **Physical Trading Floors**: Stock exchanges, like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), were bustling physical trading floors where brokers and traders would meet in person to buy and sell stocks.
    - **Open Outcry**: Traders used hand signals and shouted bids and offers to negotiate prices. This system, known as the open outcry system, was the primary method of executing trades.
    
    ### 2. **Stock Tickers and Tape Machines**:
    
    - **Stock Ticker Machines**: Information on stock prices was transmitted via ticker tape machines. These machines printed the latest stock prices on a continuous strip of paper, known as the ticker tape, which was updated as trades occurred.
    - **Broker Offices**: Ticker tape machines were often found in broker offices, where traders and investors could see the latest prices and make decisions accordingly.
    
    ### 3. **Paper-Based Transactions**:
    
    - **Stock Certificates**: Ownership of shares was represented by physical stock certificates. When a stock was bought or sold, the corresponding certificate had to be manually transferred from the seller to the buyer.
    - **Clearing and Settlement**: The clearing and settlement process was manual and took several days (often up to a week). This involved matching buy and sell orders, ensuring the correct stock certificates were transferred, and updating the records in the books of the company.
    
    ### 4. **Role of Brokers**:
    
    - **Intermediaries**: Investors typically placed their buy or sell orders through brokers. These brokers acted as intermediaries, physically present on the trading floor, who would execute trades on behalf of their clients.
    - **Broker-Client Interaction**: Investors would call their brokers to place orders. The broker would then relay the order to the trading floor, where it was executed in person.
    
    ### 5. **Market Orders and Execution**:
    
    - **Order Types**: Investors could place various types of orders, such as market orders (to buy or sell at the best available price) or limit orders (to buy or sell at a specified price).
    - **Trade Execution**: The trader or broker on the floor would physically find a counterparty to the trade, agree on a price, and execute the transaction. The details were then recorded manually.
    
    ### 6. **Market Information and Research**:
    
    - **Manual Research**: Investors relied on newspapers, company reports, and broker analyses for information on stocks and companies. Information flow was slower, and obtaining up-to-date data required significant effort.
    - **Telephone Communication**: Telephones were critical for communication between brokers, clients, and other market participants. Trades were often confirmed via phone calls before being executed.
    
    ### 7. **Delayed Price Reporting**:
    
    - **Price Reporting Lag**: The information on trades and price changes was not instant. There was a time lag between when a trade was executed and when it was reported on the ticker tape or in newspapers.
    
    ### 8. **Manual Record-Keeping**:
    
    - **Bookkeeping**: All transactions, including stock ownership and transfer records, were maintained manually in ledgers by brokerage firms and companies.
    - **Reconciliation**: Regular reconciliation was needed to ensure that records were accurate, which was a time-consuming process.
    
    ### 9. **End-of-Day Closing**:
    
    - **Daily Close**: At the end of each trading day, brokers and traders would reconcile their trades, finalize transactions, and prepare for the next day. The day’s activities were summarized and shared with clients.
    
    ### Conclusion:
    
    The pre-computer stock market was characterized by a slower, more physical, and manual process, with human brokers playing a central role in executing trades and managing information. The introduction of computers and electronic trading systems later revolutionized the stock market, greatly increasing efficiency, speed, and accessibility.

- Quantitative stock trading, often referred to as "quant trading," is a trading strategy that relies on mathematical models, statistical analysis, and algorithmic execution to make trading decisions. Here's an overview:
    
    ### 1. **What is Quantitative Stock Trading?**
    
    - **Data-Driven Approach**: Quant trading uses large amounts of data and complex mathematical models to identify trading opportunities. The goal is to exploit patterns, trends, and inefficiencies in the market that are often imperceptible to human traders.
    - **Algorithms and Automation**: Trades are executed using algorithms—pre-programmed instructions that automatically buy or sell stocks based on specific conditions identified by the quantitative models.
    
    ### 2. **Key Components of Quant Trading**
    
    - **Mathematical Models**: Quant traders develop models that predict future price movements based on historical data. These models might include factors like price trends, volume, volatility, correlations, and other financial indicators.
    - **Statistical Analysis**: Techniques like regression analysis, machine learning, and time series analysis are used to detect patterns and forecast market behavior.
    - **Backtesting**: Before deploying a strategy in the live market, it is backtested on historical data to evaluate its performance and fine-tune the parameters.
    - **Risk Management**: Quant trading strategies incorporate risk management techniques to control exposure and minimize losses. This includes setting stop-loss orders, diversifying portfolios, and adjusting position sizes based on market conditions.
    
    ### 3. **Types of Quant Trading Strategies**
    
    - **High-Frequency Trading (HFT)**: Involves executing a large number of trades in fractions of a second to capture small price discrepancies. HFT requires sophisticated technology and direct market access to execute trades with minimal latency.
    - **Statistical Arbitrage**: Seeks to profit from short-term price inefficiencies between related securities, such as pairs trading (e.g., two correlated stocks temporarily diverge in price).
    - **Market Making**: Involves providing liquidity to the market by placing both buy and sell orders simultaneously, earning profits from the bid-ask spread.
    - **Momentum Trading**: Attempts to capitalize on the continuation of existing market trends, buying stocks that have shown upward momentum and selling those with downward momentum.
    - **Mean Reversion**: Assumes that prices will revert to their historical averages over time. Traders using this strategy buy undervalued stocks (expecting them to rise) and sell overvalued ones (expecting them to fall).
    
    ### 4. **Technology and Infrastructure**
    
    - **Data Feeds**: Real-time and historical market data are crucial for developing and executing quant strategies. This data includes stock prices, volumes, news, social media sentiment, and economic indicators.
    - **Computing Power**: Quant trading requires significant computational resources to process large datasets, run complex models, and execute trades in real time. Many firms use powerful servers and cloud computing for this purpose.
    - **Execution Platforms**: Algorithms are deployed on trading platforms that connect directly to exchanges. These platforms are designed to minimize latency and execute trades as quickly as possible.
    
    ### 5. **Role of Machine Learning and AI**
    
    - **Pattern Recognition**: Machine learning algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data to identify patterns that may not be apparent through traditional statistical methods.
    - **Adaptive Strategies**: AI-driven models can adapt to changing market conditions by learning from new data and adjusting trading strategies dynamically.
    - **Sentiment Analysis**: Advanced models can incorporate sentiment analysis from news articles, social media, and other text-based sources to predict market movements.
    
    ### 6. **Challenges and Risks**
    
    - **Model Risk**: Quant strategies rely on models that are based on historical data, which may not always predict future market behavior accurately. Unexpected events or market shifts can lead to significant losses.
    - **Data Quality**: The accuracy and reliability of data are critical. Poor-quality or incomplete data can lead to flawed models and poor trading decisions.
    - **Market Impact**: Large orders generated by quant strategies can move the market, especially in less liquid securities, potentially leading to slippage and reduced profitability.
    - **Regulatory Concerns**: High-frequency and algorithmic trading have been subject to increased scrutiny and regulation due to concerns about market stability, fairness, and transparency.
    
    ### 7. **Popular Tools and Languages**
    
    - **Programming Languages**: Python, R, MATLAB, and C++ are commonly used for developing quant trading models due to their powerful libraries and efficiency.
    - **Quantitative Tools**: Software like QuantConnect, Quantlib, and proprietary trading platforms are used to backtest strategies, simulate trades, and manage risk.
    
    ### 8. **Market Participants**
    
    - **Hedge Funds**: Many hedge funds specialize in quantitative trading, leveraging sophisticated models to generate returns.
    - **Proprietary Trading Firms**: These firms trade their own capital using quant strategies, often focusing on high-frequency trading.
    - **Institutional Investors**: Large asset managers and pension funds may use quant strategies to optimize their portfolios and enhance returns.
    
    ### Conclusion:
    
    Quantitative stock trading represents a highly sophisticated, data-driven approach to investing in financial markets. It leverages mathematical models, statistical analysis, and algorithmic execution to identify and exploit trading opportunities, often with minimal human intervention. While offering the potential for significant profits, quant trading also comes with challenges, including model risk, data quality issues, and regulatory scrutiny.
    

There’s more money than ever in the stock market, there are more people trading today than at any time in history—> hold this thought 2#

We can all unanimously agree that food is best prepared by a chef, and it’s best served by a real person, it needs that personal touch. I am not talking about automating human aesthetics, you cannot—> just to be clear for those who love or earn from making a controversy.

Some people are also confused about whats human aesthetic with many processes that can become better with advanced tech like automation and AI. 

I want to keep this essay about Emerging Capitalism, therefore, won’t go much into “how to automate?” Though, improving or streamlining a process does not necessarily mean replacing it with previous like for like steps. 

The reason people are unable to objectively talk about improving economic systems is because some how everyone has tied their professional or person identity to this or that school of economics + political ideology, when in truth almost nothing is just as simplistic. Most of the economically socialistic leaning parties are funded by capitalist means, and most of the capitalists are using socialist techniques to manage the populace. If your thinking is a hypocritical mess then your actions are not going to be any better.

There is no optimal way to just distribute the money, and still keep growing our body or brains in the long term, made of many short terms. What we need to be doing is reducing the gap between an actual opportunity <—> a real human being. Hold this thought 3#. 

As already stated here—> [Adapting temporary socialist techniques in a capitalist system to fill in the gaps is a completely different matter, and has proven to work in the short term with acute awareness of such implementations to effect change or transition, rather than dependence—> resulting in long term malpractice.](AI%20Native%20Open%20Source%20Governing%20Systems%20and%20Evolvi%20472d32861d014e6498c466c9b6495bd0.md) It’s fine to adapt temporary socialistic mechanisms to bring under privileged or under represented sections of the society up to speed and close an open loop. But, sustained socialistic practices could be used by authoritarians or dictators to manipulate by making sections of the population dependent on social incentives, rather than enabling the populace to be economically independent—> so that the capitalism machine is working like a clockwork for everyone including the young and elders, rather than being used by autocrats for staying “in power” by fiddling with values of a democratic nation.

Earnest Capitalism based systems can be iterated upon to fix any errors in the machine, but also important for preservation of robust democratic mechanisms vs rigidity of socialistic practices as primary or sustained mechanisms. 

Your livelihood is better served when your life decisions are your own choice, rather than at the behest of some egoistic authority unable to see past their own bubble.
