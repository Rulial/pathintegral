It’s 2006, I was interested in acting. Not to become a superstar or anything but more about exploring the self. I was also interesting in writing. I just wanted to do more. There was no plan but that never scared me. 

I was already playing sports, even though going nowhere with it, you can’t champion everything but you can do a lot of things if you can spin that cricket ball around the legs. There were times when I was not scared, didn’t feel any pressure and those were the moments no one could touch that ball. Sports helps you recognise your strength and weaknesses. At some point, I realised being wrong about this whole game of cricket; you see I was not trying to build a career but trying to bowl the perfect ball again and again and again. It’s impossible. You can’t enjoy the game with that mentality, you can’t alway land the perfect punch and can’t continuously bowl the perfect ball.

The late great Shane Warne often got battered around by the batsman, but he obviously knew better than to take pressure and sneaked in those perfect balls when it mattered. Even if you can come close to perfection, there’s a lot that goes along to continuously replicate it, you gotta build yourself into that kind of machine both mentally and physically. I didn’t know any better.

Got to do some theatre at that time, met some interesting people and felt how little emotional knowledge I had about myself. Acting is mostly about exploring your own emotions while writing is mostly about exploring the void of whatever you are writing about. Imagine writing about your own self. Huh?!

Days before leaving the job in 2008 and going to the UK, I had one of the strangest interaction when Vineet Walimbe, a friend from the theatre workshop called saying he’s moving to Mumbai for a job. We met in Bandra, he was anxious for some reason and scared of staying alone at his paying guest accommodation known as “Rose’s Cottage.” He kind of insisted that I stay the night at this place. I was like “a ghost cottage in Bandra?! Alright!” It could have been used as a horror movie set. Old style decor, dogs barking outside, no attached toilets. I hardly slept, he kept acting weird the whole time. Somehow, I made it out first thing in the morning and spent the last day worrying about Prashant Buyyala’s tantrums.

Lets skip to December 2013…

Back from the UK, failed crowd funding attempt, not able to send ‘Phil Was There’ to any film festivalsI because of unavailability of funds. Had started the research about volumetric projection. I was trying to find a footing but still writing scripts. Had written couple of script during the year and on my way the Film Bazaar at Goa after they had already rejected one of my scripts called ‘Civil War’ for the Co Production market. Always determined and unfazed by rejection.

Back Flash—>

Even before leaving London, I had started putting together the next thing that could become a source of side income—> Rotoscoping business of all things. A middle man named Dhas Karthik based in Chennai had a project titled “Zodiac” starring ‘Jackie Chan’ that Dhas was unable to complete on his own. I roped in Shobit Taneja from Jaipur, Rajasthan, a “friend” from India who used to work with me at RnH to put together a team in India while taking care of all the initial communication from UK with the middleman.

Shobit was in the same department and we became friends working on the same project at RnH. He used to help the management make websites for event as well. Seemed talented. We used to talk discuss entrepreneurial ideas all the time from Garbage recycling to anything else. The most weird thing was when he showed me a movie called “The Man From Earth” and expecting to be praised for it! It’s the most pretentious movie I had ever seen and thought it was funny that he took it so seriously. lol. I was in touch with him on and off through out the stay in The UK. He made a basic website for ‘Marty Unplugged’, i was not keeping up with websites and felt good to take help, involve people. At one point we even tried to develop a movie based on a book titled “The Roaches have no King” by Daniel Weiss, I was even in touch with the author. It was too early and felt like I was over indulging without there being any money in it.

I changed the ‘Marty Unplugged’ website without telling Shobit because it needed an update—> moved the information to a company website. We were not business partners or in any deal, I was grateful for his help but didn’t know he needed to be notified. He probably sent it to one of his client and felt otherwise. 

While trying to figure out a lot of things, as you have read, I thought could trust this person till I could make an active day to day contribution to day to day talent management. But I was taking daily note of progress. I used to trust everyone till people started breaking it. Shobit got together along with few other people I knew and decided to screw me over. I kept trying to push them to come clean but to no vail. We could have had a conversation re my % or their grievances but they preferred cheating. I should have fought?—> well, i thought let’s concentrate on better things rather than rolling in the mud with idiots. Facts don’t need advocacy, these are facts. 

Added August 2024—> In 2013, Suchit’s sister Shipra had called me for a meeting for some potential work at the local college in Jor Bag , she used to teach. Even though I was struggling at that time being back from London and a bit lost, the work had nothing to do with my skills and didn’t seem appropriate, I went to the meeting out of courtesy. At the same time,  When you have nothing, anything could lead to something. It went pretty much as expected, not being a right fit. I ended up at Shipra and Mohit’s temp home, as their actual home was under renovation—> while leaving, they really insisted that I visit the toilet, I found it weird because I didn’t want to urinate at that time. I always felt she was a bit of a two faced person and didn’t trust them, to begin with. 

First time I remember anyone shout on top of their lungs is Shipra, during the ceremonies following the funeral of our common grandfather. Because she felt my parents were not taking note of her parent's advice. Anyway.

Regular Programming—>

Had three interviews in Mumbai. One at content creation company called “Jack in the Box”, another a company providing rotoscoping services to the west run by couple of people from New York, and another one at Games2win—> had a fine meeting with their CEO Alok Kejriwal. They already liked some of the ideas on my resume and asked to provide 5 concepts + quote a price.

Had no idea at that time how to price this role. So, dug around a bit, did not care about the short term but wanted it to be fair. By the way, had already been working for 6 years on all kinds of international projects. It was not a down point by any stretch of imagination other than being on a tight string money wise.

Anyway, gave them 5 ideas within a day and figured how much they make for the game, therefore, quoted based on a revenue sharing model knowing it might not be accepted but they will negotiate or make a long term commitment. However, suddenly it became a power game with the other side wanting to give only Rs. 10,000.00 per concept inc all complete development work and no rev share at all or any up side. Also, the CEO himself cc’d his whole team giving one of the most illogical analogy I have heard till this day—> “Also, what it costs someone is no way to cost what you provide!! It costs 1472 crores to buy an Airbus plan - yet your ticket from Mumbai to Delhi still costs 7500 :-)”

My Reply to above was—> “Well, yes one AirBus might cost 1472 crore and I am paying Rupees 7500- because I am a customer, same as the people downloading your app for $0.99 and not the other way around :). The guy who came up with the designs of the Airbus is surely not paid Rupees 7500. :)”

His logic was not even based on the right premise. I later read on social media that his consideration was based on my age which is even more bizarre.

I did not even want to work for this person anymore but at the same time also did not have any ill will for him because he seemed so full of himself and egoistic—> had learned to not burn bridges. Productivity is not just “logging hours” but to have clear thinking that is rather than focused only on ego boosting is focused on problem solving and at the right time can turn into actionable thinking which is logical in both long and short term—> therefore, true productivity is priced based on its actual value.

Met couple of interviewers at “Jack in the Box” but their creative director was apparently scared of that I was not adapt to be his minion. Well judged on his part.

The interview at the rotoscoping company went well but then they like everything else, it turned 360 degrees. I had supervised so many rotos by this point, it seemed ridiculous to not get even this job.

I moved to stay with Vineet Walimbe during this time for 2 week in Thane. He screened ‘Pulp Fiction’ which was probably the only Tarantino film I had not seen at that point. But left for a hunting trip while leaving the apartment to me. His behaviour was strange this time as well. I didn’t want to stay there when he came back and moved to the hotel in South Bombay.

Had stayed at this Hotel one week before moving to Vineet’s place. You could not find this hotel on the map at that time. In Crawford Market, the hotel on the third floor was visible from the street outside but the entrance was concealed behind a whole layer of front shops, leading to a spiral stairs from like 1800’s, dusty like no one had walked up these stairs for 100 of years after they got burned. I thought it was quite magical, felt like Harry Potter. If someone ended up there by accident, there’s no way they would think there’s a hotel up there. 

Started climbing up, there were no boards or signs but a mop drying on the second floor!  Sunlight coming through the windows on every floor covered with thin net which was filled with dust. Finally, made it to the top floor, pushed the wooden door and it was a real hotel though set slightly back in time. There was a middle aged man with mouth full of paan and few of his assistants. Communal toilets, Indian style. No Air con, of course. On subsequent visits, it was slightly got better.

So, back there, I got really sick. Puked and shitted at the same time on the foot path after falling down because of dizziness. A kind security guard picked me up and brought some water. Came back to the hotel, asked if they had any tablets, the manager gave me ‘Pudinhara’ for 5 rupees. I left those pants back at the hotel after taking a quick shower and left.

It was not all bad. Before that incident I had the encounter with the street kids, based on which I eventually wrote still to be made animated film ‘HEX.’ Also, I saw Sachin Tendulkar for the first time! He was sitting on the window seat of a tour bus going towards Cricket Club of India or Wankhade Stadium and we definitely looked at each other, at least, I like to think that 😉.

Back to the future—>

Took a train to Goa. Checked into a better hotel. I was surprised they made them like this as well. lol.

I was confident about the ‘Civil War’ script being a good first draft. It was high concept and not about a “Civil War” itself, different from anything on the market. Setup to work internationally but relevant to core Indian issues with relatable situations and characters. Emailed anyone on the delegates list and everyone was dying to meet me! lol. Of course, they were not. Hardly anyone replied at all. 

One notable person who replied was a Sanjay Suri. 

Detour—>

Growing up I really loved this movie titled ‘Jhankar Beats.’ A musical but different. Contemporary. Based in Mumbai but unique vibe. Remixed S. D. Burman music was even better and one of the few music tapes I bought as it was a dying trend by my time. The songs often played on the radio as well. Among other people, it starred Juhi Chawla and Sanjay Suri in leading roles.

Back to the future—>

I met Sanjay, it was fine. Obviously, nothing was gonna happen right there. He did not really get the idea but was friendly. That’s his thing. No, really. I would figure that out in a few years.

There were a few people I had known from before but they were not receptive and felt like were questioning my basic skills. “I wonder why?!”

Another person who replied was a Canadian producer Jan Nathanson. She was really nice which might have something to do with Baldy Rakhra of Fair Street with whom I tried to crowdfund the short film earlier that year. Anyway, Jan heard my pitch and introduced me to Guneet Monga who had just produced ‘Lunch Box’ starring Nimrat Kaur and Irfan Khan, doing really well on the festival circuit around the world. Maybe, I missed a beat in the repeat performance but was asked to send the script and stay in touch.

That was pretty much whole of my Film Bazaar experience other than meeting a really great Casting Director and few other people. Lot of these people use weird language and complicate matters to establish power dynamics. After the last few years I have had, complicated was the last thing I wanted. Also, my impression from attending the event was that if I had to make a dent in the space and time of filmmaking as a director, and not get caught up in its fabric then I gotta make a no budget independent film.

Back from that event on train via Mumbai. I had been trying to create a source of income as well and tried to start a business of something with a contact who was providing rotos to Jake, an Anuj Jain. I was to try to establish a rotoscoping facility because of all the 2d to 3d conversions going on at that time. 

After been screwed over by Shobit and Co, i was just not into it anymore. Anuj and I even signed a contract for the use of his office but I was unable to meet him during the short time during transit between Goa and Mumbai. On the train ride back, I was in the same coach with ‘Reiki group’, one of the girls wanted my lower side berth and gave it to her. But also, some older people going on a pilgrimage to Mathura. Among the older people were a couple talking about a one sided contract their son had signed for use of his facility that sounded eerily similar to the contract I had signed with Anuj. Not much there. But I was spooked out and not wanting to get into another potential mess. My anxiety issues were not fixed yet.

Sent ‘Civil War’ script to anyone who had asked, tried to keep up but pretty much gave up as none of it seemed to be going anywhere, and started working on “The Great Indian Rope Trick.” An idea i had been developing for few years. All this while, I was also brewing the kids animated film idea in the subconscious.

Met Guneet again at an event on Buddha International Circuit in Greater Noida. I nicely requested her to reply to my emails! 🙂 The event was weird itself. I was acting bit of a honest loud mouth. There was an interaction session with Ms. Atishi Marlena of AAP during this event. A question of improving quality of life was being discussed, issues related to labour, and corruption—> I gave them suggestion to properly implement minimum wages, among couple of other tidbits. Organisers didn’t like it much. I am sorry if you don’t like ground truth but asking me to have a reality check. What to do?!

I was adamant of not wanting to write a proper script because already had a bunch of them and I can’t help writing drafts to improve scripts as part of the process. Then it always builds up to needing a lot of money! I had none! And, the failed crowd funding campaign had already proved that no one was interested—> [“CROWD” FUNDING—> Personal + Factual](%E2%80%9CCROWD%E2%80%9D%20FUNDING%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Factual%2024bd81e6483e41a2b6188e29fb35b626.md) 

What really hurt me was even Shuchi didn’t share it with anyone or put some notoriety amount like rupee 100?! If not for anything else, I still helped her get the job. It was another hopeless situation. lol. Not complaining, just expressing.

Maybe, I was being prepared in becoming expert of dealing with hopeless situations. That’s how you learn to laugh 🤣 and find hope.

This timeline is now running in parallel with the start up endeavours and work written about here—> [HOW NOT TO START UP? 3D Edition—> Personal + Factual](HOW%20NOT%20TO%20START%20UP%203D%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Factual%20c486fc8f6f7a4a1ba2e67f3e3e689881.md) 

Got a permanent remote side job working for Mr. Malik’s new construction business. It didn’t pay much but kept me going with the ability to move around. I thought the startup thing will start paying out at some point and I won’t have to rely on this job but also be able to fund the ‘The Great Indian Rope Trick.’

Had been in touch with Rikhil Bahadur and his girl friend Shachi Sharma, they were trying to make a feature film version of the short film. Read the script. Didn’t like it. Offered to rewrite and produce. He was not interested. Moved on. They got funded by Viacom 18 and some other people, called me in Jan 2014 about not being able to complete it on schedule. Needing to reshoot and if I would like to come aboard as Chief AD for the reshoot. I took the gig. We completed it on schedule. Did it for the passion of film making and a token Rupee 5000 only. He did not call me to the preview screening. Okay—> always cheap attitude. Never saw the actual film.

29th Nov 2024

Like his short film, this was also based in a school, guess he was fascinated about the school life. Unlike the previous time, where I used my Facebook to manage actors, I did not add any of the cast to my socials. Rikhil was quite giddy with them, which is fine, but I maintained distance. Even though I was interested in potential of some actors, I had thought of approaching them via Rikhil if ever wanting to cast them in my films. 

For the record, even earlier I never asked out any actors from the cast or crew or ever made any objectionable comments to them or indulged in any other activity with anyone.

Made couple of contacts in THE CREW from the above shoot. I thought would be useful in making ‘The Great Indian Rope Trick’/ ‘TGIRT’ with zero budget, on the fly, documentary style. But it’s difficult to shoot anything on actually zero budget. It was a desperate attempt. There was the pressure of paying the education loan which has ballooned by now. Brother was going through a divorce, there were strange situations. 

I contacted Roopak Saluja, CEO of rebranded “Jack in the Box” as 120p Media collective for this film. Of course, I was a bit desperate but having patience does not mean being taken for granted. Especially, once the conversation has started. How can it take you 3 months to move forward or say “no?” While being given weirdest of excuses. I liked the company, thought we could do something together. 

Detour—>

Around this time attended another weddings, not reluctantly. I like good things happening to people even if snowflakes can’t appreciate. Arpit Aggarwal, brother of Suchit. His wife’s elder sister had recently been on a project with Sanjay Suri, i was told. Was still exchanging emails with Sanjay. The wedding went cordially for the most part.

Regular Programming—>

I met Sanjay during one of his visits to Delhi and didn’t seem like it will go anywhere. If you treat business like business rather than thinking you are doing favours to people than a lot can happen, but if you don’t then it gets difficult. Film market is not like other markets, it’s only an argument of those who don’t understand actual filmmaking to make only those films that are “working” in the market. He was not even doing that. It’s probably the most stupid approach to making movies. We will come back to this but read the FAQ for my detailed views—> [FAQ—> To be updated. Not completely relevant in current context.](../../Side%20Ventures%20Projects%200ff66237567480838aa4ee58f9698b05/Untitled%2010066237567480a1bcf8d520bc67d477/HEX%E2%80%94%20Animated%20Feature%20Film%20d24b205092464cd59a31a115e330bb04/FAQ%E2%80%94%20To%20be%20updated%20Not%20completely%20relevant%20in%20curr%20db5701a59b454e9db44dac002f167961.md) 

I was still looking to build ‘TGIRT’ with minimum budget but a proper team. That’s when I got in touch with a Mithun Gomes, he had responded to my advertisement on [mandy.com](http://mandy.com) looking for collaborators. We fixed a meeting at their office in R K Puram—> it was himself and Surbhi Dewan as advertised. They said that I was difficult to look up on internet and I thought these people don’t know how to use google? lol. They seemed fine, passionate about the craft, had some good ideas, most of all I thought we could their office/ home as one of the locations. Mithun was a cinematographer, Surbhi seemed equipped to handle production. It was supposed to be a ‘no budget film’ after all!

Explained them my logic of not having written a proper script for this project because then I get too detail oriented, budget shoots up and thing doesn’t get made. They didn’t seem to get my arguments, which was good. We registered a company as a vehicle to manage finances and the production. They were a little apprehensive but cooperative. We used my Chartered Accountant mama Ji/ uncle based in Karol Bagh to register the company. He took a similar amount as anyone else was quoting in the market while telling me he charges much more from usual clients. I always paid him whenever his services were used. He would also keep telling me about one of his relative calling him at Shangri-La Hotel then scamming, I used that hotel as a location for a meeting between scamsters in the script. You take what you get. lol. 

I was not running a pyramid scheme at any point or anything else but trying to make a movie. To potentially earn money by exhibition, then you get to make more movies. Just like anything else. People are more alarmed by artist being honest but drooling out of greed when actual con man are telling them about the schemes. Also, how honest are CA’s?! Their whole thing is to help clients save tax by lying and investing in fake things.

I liked Mithun and Surbhi even better now, they were more efficient than SixD! We had a company and a bank account in Yes Bank! Other than Mithun kept pestering me to get a 0% interest loan from ‘Dena Bank’ for financing the film. Told him thats not happening. Anyone who has read film history knows it’s foolish to make movies by taking a loan out of a bank. Let’s say you are earning $100,000 a month and take a $50,000 credit line if you are an independent filmmaker or entrepreneur. I was not even earning $5000 but I am not stupid. I would have invested my own money had one of the startup things had worked. Also, loans are hardly given as advertised, there are ton of Terms and Conditions. Almost no bank gives an outright loan to make film. Some provide Gap financing or shortfall or credit line based on deals in place. But if you don’t have your own money, then you attach investors not only for the money but they also help it showcase and spread. The product also gets better in the process.

You need people to disagree with you to make things better. Had a meeting with Surbhi and Mithun about the script blueprint document, and after that I ended up writing a relatively proper script. Still a bit reluctant because like explained before, this project was about going out there and shooting rather than spending years on securing finance.

But here we were again. I was trying all other avenues to find finance as it was a full on feature film script now and making it for no budget was no longer an option. I wrote a short film script based in the same universe as ‘TGIRT’ but not quite part of the same narrative arc as the actual movie—> partly inspired by listening and glimpses of ‘Crime Patrol’ and ‘Breaking Bad.’ No actual content was pulled from anywhere. You are welcome to read for determination of originality from draft 1.

The first VR workshop was done at their place and it was apparently was a success. I thought they were “a thing” from the onset. But then got told me Mithun has proposed Surbhi but families were not accepting their relationship initially. Then after a while they were accepted and had a proper marriage at Eros Hotel in Nehru Place. I attended but was not introduced to anyone at all. So, I left early…anxiousness was still an issue.

Bitcoin is a major plot point of ‘The Great Indian Rope Trick’ because why not?! I had been following it for a while, never had the money to buy any but wasn’t gonna waste the research. It was not too technical but if the audience paid attention than other than being entertained they would have left the cinema with some basic knowledge about the famous crypto currency. Other than the story itself, that was another globally appealing and selling point of the project. Initially, I had the idea of making it as a hybrid using animated sequences to explain the magic trick and bitcoin analogy. But I scrapped that idea for simplicity and banking more on the story itself rather than gimmicks.

There was a lot happening in the film industry at that time and financing didn’t seem like the biggest issue with we had it packaged properly, now that it was not a no budget independent movie. At the same time, getting a bit frustrating because I was the only one making any efforts, but marriage had worked as a motivation—> two leading characters were westerners and in particular I wanted ‘Clive Owen’ after witnessing his wonderful performances in ‘Children of Men’ and ‘The Knick’  to play FBI agent along with ‘Joanna Christie’ from Narcos to play an investigative journalist. It was not really possible to get Clive without a mutual connection or some funds in place. However, Joanna seemed approachable, we contacted her agent who was really professional. Had a video call with Joanna, assured that the script will be better and we had her intent to play the role on paper.

This further motivated the newly married couple and we decided to visit Mumbai together by getting rest of the cast together. We wanted to get everything together and firmly on paper because from there you can approach anyone to make deals. They flew and I took the train. 

The education loan was paid by now through efforts by Dad in which I supported by helping him with all travel arrangements, and keeping him not tread away from the line. 

Detour—>

I was writing a lot of other stuff in the meanwhile. It was all constantly improving. Internal progress does not need a lot of money. I had been to Mumbai myself few months before this trip to find suitors for ‘You are a Xingji’ a series and ‘Doordarshan’ an anthology series like Black Mirror but different. Had another meeting with a producer at again rebranded “Jack in the box” shared stuff with them after we signed mutual NDA’s. 

Met another couple of folks, Sameer Pitalwalla and their newly appointed head of content Ruchir Joshi from this company called “Culture Machine.” They showed some interest in putting together the series for platforms. But nothing actually moving in the direction of meaningful progress.

Regular Programming—>

We were now going for character actors for the roles whilst trying to put the TGIRT short film together we had contacted ‘Huma Kureshi’, ‘Kalki Koelchin’, ‘Aditi Rao Hydri’, ‘Nimrat Kaur’ and ‘Vipin Sharma’, ‘Vivan Shah’ among few others through contacts details from Mithun and Surbhi’s casting director friend. Everyone really liked that script. We tried to make that short as a stand alone thing but NO FUNDS! Then I incorporated that short into a new draft of the script. 

We met Tisca Chopra along with her fabulous assistant who seemed generally patronised. lol. I had been fan of Tisca since seeing an episode on some TV anthology other than movies like ‘Taare Jameen Par, of course. She was pleasant and enthusiastic. Mithun and Surbhi thought we were flirting but it was all respect. She offered to help with introductions and funding from Mahindra and Mahindra! Okay! I liked the idea of snoozing with billionaires. lol. This could have been a pathway to my home galaxy, you never know 😭😁

We also met Vicky Kaushal at his home, he was also nice. Honestly, I don’t get star stuck by anyone and he was not famous then but had the thing about him. He’s wonderful. Even though we totally mis judged him for the proposed role. I had bit too much coffee and was bouncing around a bit. He thought I had bought the ‘HoloLens’ which I was carrying around everywhere, but told him I just kept it because the people who bought it owed me money.

Sanjay Suri had a movie out around that time. It was funny. I realised he’s probably not a good fit for the role. But he was nice to walk all the way from his house to ‘Leaping Windows’ a semi famous joint in that neighbourhood. I haven’t actually seen any of his movies other than ‘Jhankar Beats’ in full x multiple times and ‘My Brother Nikhil’ in parts, but have praised them all 🤣 you gotta pull people out of their perceived holes somehow and compliments always work 🤷🏽‍♂️

I thought Sharukh Khan would be best for this role 🤷🏽‍♂️ and I could give a second renaissance to his career 😁😉 but had no mutual contacts! lol! 

Next day, we were having a meeting in the same cafe with Mithun and Surbhi’s friend Shayam Bora whist Onir was sitting at his usual spot, next to the window, listening to everything. I figured its him the first time around and spotted sitting there on many occasions. Other than the usual “reality check” Shayam was quite helpful. No one says “hard no” to anything in that town because “you never know.” He shared a power point presentation with us upon reaching Delhi, I liked it, nothing unique but suitable.

Before leaving town we met Shashank Arora of ‘Titli’ and ‘Made in Heaven’, he was perfect for the role and had been in touch with him for a while. He was his usual self, in the zone and obviously nice. We then ran from his place to meet Ruchir at ‘Culture Machine’ to discuss ‘Doordarshan’ as I had Rajdhani train to catch in the evening. They had been showing interest but not doing anything. The meeting was weird like trying to entice Surbhi and Mithun into some documentary production which I don’t mind in terms of opportunity, but not quite professional while I am sitting right there.

We were back in Delhi but determined to get this together, at least I was! Once you have momentum, it’s foolish to not build on it but in fact wilfully lose it. Met Ranvir Shorey in his trailer while shooting a film a near slum construction site around ITO/ Pragati Maidan. He was for real. Had few queries but agreed to the role.

We had an invitation to attend a book launch at Ashoka Hotel by Tisca Chopra, also attended by Barkha Dutt. I attended with Surbhi only as Mithun was away on some project. Asked an important question of the panel. Just wanted to show up to assure Tisca that we are serious people, well almost. There was an incident where some semi celebrity was trying to hit on Surbhi apparently or not. Weird. She told me it’s the same place Mithun had proposed her as we were leaving. Dropped her at their place and took another cab back to mine in Faridabad. I always have little bit more information in one to one interaction and was annoyed about couple of things but nothing that needed to be addressed for now. You need to ignore somethings about colleagues, no one is perfect but I didn’t talk about it behind their back either.

They shot some corporate video in that was supposed to be in 3D but was not, helped them figure that out. Mithun was making a massive issue about us using similar design as in the presentation shared by Shayam Bora. We didn’t copy his slides, there was nothing to copy! Didn’t even use the same colours but only the flow of information but about our movie! Their presentation was about their company and movies. I didn’t get his argument. Funding was important. I asked Mithun to send a better design and he shared some unpresentable crap. In btw, Surbhi helped me edit the script, we spent the whole day at their office. Even though it took awhile to realise this after working with another editor couple of times more—> I didn’t needed an editor ever since. Another pair of eyes are always helpful but I had figured out the process! 

We were having some or other conversations with all involved including Tisca and a DOP with tentative dates to shoot. I was also talking to few people for funding. Had a meeting with Sandeep Ji at this place in Badarpur where we were supposed to discuss things about all the demos I was giving for him. Surbhi called me at that same time, this project was more important so I had to make Sandeep Ji wait. She sounded stressed as Mithun was feeling left out with myself and her leading most of the work on the film. I told her that it’s not intentional other than him not having relevant ideas. Also, I thought she was more of a creative lead from their company on this project whilst he’s taking care of the day to day. I was annoyed because Mithun was hardly doing anything but making unnecessary arguments like this! He could have picked up anything and started doing it! Who was stopping him?! Look for funding?! Create mood boards?! Work with the DOP?! Why did you need my permission?! But be ready to hear NO if your ideas don’t align. We finally had some momentum but they were throwing me a curve ball, I felt a need be assertive in asking for an immediate meeting.

Next thing I know, Surbhi stopped communicating. Mithun started communicating on her behalf and acting weird. He said I shouted at her—> I never shouted at her! This was an over reaction to say the least. Anyway, they decided to quit. I asked them to reconsider but they were adamant. We agreed to them quitting but keep it to themselves till I figure something out to not lose momentum. Next day itself, I was talking to one of the actors who told me that they have already received an email from my partners about leaving this project. I was pissed now. I called Mithun and he denied it but I had already received a copy of their email to everyone. That’s betrayal of trust once again and lying.

The project was all but done for now. I did not create a scene. Carried out the proceedings for them to resign from the company without any fuss at all. We met one last time at Social, Nehru Place to handover things. Didn’t complain at that time or to anyone else. Whatever. I am a big boy.

‘Culture Machine’ were not making any progress for whatever reasons, therefore, had asked them to stop pitching the project.

But if this was not enough, I saw a short film on YouTube starring ‘Prachi Desai’ and ‘Jacky Bhagnani’ titled ‘Carbon’ copied from one of my original scripts titled ‘Linger.’ I have all the draft from 1 to whatever that were shared with lot of people. It was like fuck it, at least I know for sure people are stealing my ideas! The only problem was that the short film they made was shit. I got plenty of ideas and that was not the only one people stole. Guess what?! My “claim” of ghost writing many projects are not at all based on hubris. Go figure.

Still owned all the content that I had made and was still making. Hololens was with me and was experimenting with it. Had a steady side income with occasional bonuses from the construction business which was also helping me develop areas I won’t have got to work on otherwise. My writing was much better and constantly getting better. It was not as bad as previous times. Not somewhere I had not been before. 

Detour—>

I would often ask Mr. Malik/ Ash for some help with funding as the construction business was doing well. Particularly, due to the work from Hilton Hotel in Paddington owned by a Mrs. Bhatia, other than regular small projects. There were all kinds of legal issues which became part and parcel. His default business advice for me was to export Masala like MDH. Like what?! It had nothing to do me at all! What are you even talking about?! 😆  One of his clients was a Chinese women who had taken over a huge estate upon death of her old husband. She wanted to sell this building in Lancaster Gate which was previously a hotel for $35 million. Ash asked me to find a buyer when I told him about meeting with ultra rich politically connected people for VR projects. No one was buying a decaying building in London for that sum of money! I did try and shared it with Sandeep Ji, well it’s another in the list of “all that” 😆

I was trying to find new co producers to get “The Great Indian Rope Trick” back on track. But before that rewrote the whole script again to make it completely set in India with Indian cast. It came out quite well and tightly held! Contacted ‘Tibo Travers’ thought he might be more mature by now. He recommended his Indian girl friend who was not punctual at all, like you can’t be an hour late and not even be apologetic. Told him there’s no way I could work with her, nothing personal. He said that I should probably contact Iona Sweeney, our classmate from the MA program who was producing content but I thought that would be too opportunistic when I was never close to her though it was always cordial. Also, the kind of content they were producing didn’t seem aligned with my R rated cinematic films. Weirdly enough, Tisca ended up working on one of the films produced by that company. Relativity is for real.

Started pushing Sanjay to produce ‘TGIRT’ and was making more frequent trips now but for work because objective was still to get in a solid foundational and secure financial position. I had little income but was investing in myself, in developing skills and keeping the mind fresh to think well. His behaviour was strange, like yeah yeah definitely do this but then won’t proceed further.

One of these trips I landed at Sanjay’s house direct from the airport with the backpack, and he asked if I want to be actor?! Like dude, what are you even talking about? You have so many of my scripts. No. Then he would talk about just random stuff that nothing to do with anything. I was like maybe I should squatter on his sofa but he also needed damp work done. Lol. Let’s make this film no? To get the house renovated?! Met his wife, she was nice.

On another trip to Mumbai, I was staying in a mix of AIRBNB’s and Hotels. Whatever was affordable. Reconnected with Rikhil and his wife Shachi Sharma, they had married, seemed better though still needed to read between the lines to understand their ground truth. They liked the script. We agreed to put something down on the paper after really tough negotiations. lol. Reconnected with Sid Jain, he had just left ‘Hot Star’ and looking for new things—> I was like, let’s do this? Produce this film! I keep tabs on everyone. You never know. But he was apparently more impressed with my business model rather than my business. Reconnected with Sameer and Ruchir at ‘Culture Machine’, showed them some HoloLens Demos and we decided to work on a Mixed Reality studio with its own digital show, potentially and hopefully starring ‘Salman Khan!’ You gotta take your shots! We never spoke about working on any of my IPs.

There was this one particular AIRBNB in Versova which is one of my strangest stay anywhere. The address on Airbnb was not their actual address! Alright! A women on the other end gave me the direction to their actual building and somehow I found it. She was a production designer and her boy friend was apparently jewellery dealer, at least that’s what I was told. Gave me the only bedroom in the one bedroom apartment. A common bathroom. No air conditioner. They used to sleep in the day time and party in the night. I thought of dropping into one of those but it was not noisy and not my kind of atmosphere. Difficult to sleep for sure. They had one mattress in the living room where they used to sleep literally on top of each other. I even offered them the bedroom but they won’t have it. Good for you. 

While trying to take a shower, their tap completely came out of the wall. Thought, I am done for now! Apart from things not working out, I have broken someone’s fucking tap! lol. The water was flowing out of the wall non stop. Somehow, I was able to put the tap back into the wall and stop the water. There was still some leakage. Told them about it and they were like “that’s how the tap is basically.” Maybe, you should have told that to me before I spent half n hour trying to fix it! 😭😅 I was happy to be out of there and didn’t book an AIRBNB for a while after that.

Anyway, business was picking up again! Thought, finally I would get to show my engineering chops as well! 

ICO’s were the talk of the tech town hall at that time, was exploring if this could be used to fund TGIRT. Attended an event by some company promoting their ICO services at a co working space in Nehru Place that I used to visit sporadically. Knew more about Crypto then them but they were so full of themselves and way in over their head to ask me for money when I approached to make a potential investment in the film as a way to promote their company. Never replied when I asked for their case study brochure’s. 

Had to still figure out the contract with Rikhil and Shachi. Thought, let’s get a lawyer to do it, found a talented and wonderful lawyer from Jaipur, Rajasthan based at the co working space itself but she quoted a hilariously massive amount to draft a simple production contract and had to politely decline. 

Legal contracts are not intellectual property, this has no similarity to the flawed Airbus analogy of Mr. Kejriwal, for the inquisitive minded.

Detour—>

Attended a wonderful workshop conducted by a psychologist at the same co working space. There were handful of people inc the lawyer. Among other things there was one particular activity where everyone was given a balloon each and told that “the person with last remaining balloon 🎈 shall be the winner.” Everyone instantly started bursting each other’s balloons! I locked myself with my balloon in the toilet, not out of fear but felt like the best strategy, we were not told to burst anyone’s balloons in the instruction by the psychologist. But they came knocking at the door of the toilets! Had I opened the door, approx. 12 people in total without a balloon of their own! 4 were right at the door. I released my balloon out into the open skies through the window. It might still be somewhere among the clouds!

Thought I had won as my balloon was safe and free! But the psychologist said nobody won as everyone let their natural tendencies take over by bursting each others balloons! I gave her WTF Look and reminded that my balloon is safe, and I did not try to burst anyone else’s balloon! Her argument was that I released the balloon! But finally declared me the rightful winner! Thank you 🙏🏾 😅.

‘Culture Machine’ had not clearly discussed any financials and didn’t look like they were interested in putting any money in the Mixed Reality project. I could not understand their depriving mindset or illogical sense or anything for that matter. We needed good amount of GPU’s to run this thing if you are seriously thinking about building this stuff. Why won’t you be serious about it?! This company was funded by Tiger Global for more than $20 Million and kept raising funds. It seemed like all their funds were spent on the fancy office in Malad. They once even told me while pointing to the surroundings “all this comes at a cost” and I was thinking “at the cost of actual business and product?” I wondered what exactly was their business models at this point?! They didn’t like paying for hardware, they didn’t like paying for content and they didn’t like paying people. How much furniture can you buy?! 

Anyway, thought at least they have some presence and connections, let me use my business development skills to find some sponsors. So, I arranged a meeting with India representative of Epic Games, the company that owns Unreal Engine to find synergies and get myself enough support.

But that was only the start of their bullshit way of doing business, not being professionals, but total con artists. On the morning of this meeting at Costa Coffee, DLF Mall, Noida—> I received a text from their office saying “We are pitching You are a Xingji to Balaji Telefilms.” Some question was also asked. I was part happy and part let me figure this out. Then met Shruti from Epic Games for usual introductions and continuation on emails.

I inquired with Ruchir about pitching to Balaji and asked how are we going to proceed? He introduced me to a writer.

Rikhil and Shachi were in Delhi by this time. I was discussing TGIRT with them in the evening when I the writer Ruchir has introduced asked me to send everything to her because she was going to take over from this point. I was like hold on! Firstly, i wrote this, i own this, I should be writing it and I have no problem with another writer being on board but you are not “taking over” anything. Realised, I needed some support and witness if this gets out of hand, so, I roped in Rikhil and Shachi as my partners based in Mumbai. Drafted and sent an MOU to Culture Machine and now they had their COO talking to me. Alright. These bastards were trying to basically short change me for nothing on one project, but also conduct a robbery on another in broad day light. It was not happening. Just because I am playing nice, does not mean you will do whatever! It’s not just shabby business practices but outright lunatic behaviour. Here’s how that conversation ended—>

![IMG_0454.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Bollywood%20Edition%20Part%201%E2%80%94%20Perso%2004610fef27f84890805ede4a476af2df/IMG_0454.jpeg)

The writer was fine, she was totally understanding of my situation, and I was happy to work with her, but Bollywood suffers from a disease of thinking they need to make everything sound like Bollywood. Because of which, I am not supposed to be writing this as I am not part of their machine. Well, fuck you. They still stole bunch of my ideas from the scripts. But like I said, if you use my ideas to make crap then good luck. Lately, Ruchir has been collaborating with ‘Unreal Engine’ along with some old Rhythm and Hues colleagues. I wonder how that came about? Your welcome.

But this did not end there. I was still of the impression that we could work on the Mixed Reality project! That could still put your stupid company on path to generate real revenue. We organised to meet a month in advance with Sameer Pitalwalla during which I stopped receiving email from unreal engine. I went to Mumbai only for that meeting. They knew. I reached the domestic airport early in the morning, booked a shared OLA cab to their office because it was cheaper, a women in her mid or early 20s boarded the cab as co passenger and strangely enough she works at Culture Machine! She had just gotten out of ‘Avion Hotel’ right in front of the domestic airport. We chatted till the point i got that information.

Reached their office and it looked like they had not even properly opened yet. But then Ruchir comes through the front door, saying that Sameer was not going to come in today! Wow. Okay. So, you people are toxic along with being unprofessional?! I knew at that point this was not going anywhere at all. 

Tried pitching the idea to ‘Balaji Telefilms’ myself, but that was not realistically possible with their Hierarchy. I was able to get a meeting with one of their creative director but the same power games and dynamics started. There was another person in the meeting with a broken hand, apparently from practicing Jiu Jitsu. Ohkay?! Must be extreme. Let’s find a mutual contact, I thought. That person seemed to know Mithun Gomes. Well, I didn’t do anything bad to them. Requested Mithun to help with this which was another mistake as things only went bad from there as far as that lead was concerned.

I was still trying to work with Rikhil and Shachi as previous issues were water under the bridge, and at least they seemed reliable. However, with another couple of disappointments, i was eager and desperate to make something. Still giving tech demos on the side and by this time working with Mr. Arya’s company to get a government project in Jaipur, Rajasthan.

Wrote another short film to make with no budget! My whole family was big on watching ‘Crime Patrol’, and I used to catch glimpses while passing by. So, that theme was playing in my thoughts a lot. Wrote a sci-fi crime murder mystery. Rikhil and Shachi liked it. We thought, let’s make it! I had helped you on your short film. We had just started to move along when they told me about their financial issues and only wanting to do paid projects. Can’t blame them for wanting to get paid, but hey, what happened to the passion of film making?! Anyway. It’s fine, people have different situations and we should not be judgemental. They did help me get on ‘Screen Writer’s Association’ as before I only used to register script with WGAW and The Script Vault. A bit of local protection for IP rights is good. 

Ash was visiting Delhi for his court case stemming from juxtaposition of his alleged love affair and business dealings. He asked me to give his surety, initially I agreed but then dug around a bit, asked few lawyers inc the talented lawyer from Co working space about the nitty gritty’s. The response was not positive. Even though his lawyer, a Mr. Chowdhary thought I was overthinking it. Finally, decided against it and apparently Mr. Chowdhary gave it himself in the court. Ash was staying at Taj Palace in Delhi. Michael Clarke, the Australian cricketer was staying there at the same time. He was disappointed but I couldn’t afford to be in a dicey situation as the case involved substantial amount of money. 

Went on couple of brunches with the lawyer. She seemed interesting. Got little infatuated. Trying to help her with some clients. Told me she would be in Mumbai at the same time I was visiting. Texted her, she was based in Powai. Told her, no way I am coming all the way from Santa Cruz to Powai! But offered to watch the new “Star Wars, the last Jedi” movie, the next day, if she wanted. She never replied back! What’s wrong with Sci-fi?! 🤷🏽‍♂️

Still in touch with Sanjay, met him again in Delhi at one of his friends house in Delhi. They were aged but curious. Showed them some demos on HoloLens. They were happy, he was happy, We decided to meet on my next trip to Mumbai to take things to the next level. Even introduced me to his brother in law. So, it’s for real this time, I thought 🤷🏾‍♂️.
