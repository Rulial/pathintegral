## INTRODUCTION

****Note**: This is not an academic paper in its current form, the aim of writing this proposal is not to seek glory for a discovery but to construct a practical introduction on the subject matter from research and original assumptions based on the best available source material credited to their respective authors with the goal of designing a best use case oriented metagame. Basic rule of presenting an argument with informed assumption is that you are open to being proven wrong.

> 

****Background:** I started researching on the topic of Metagame philosophically, narratively and technically while developing a series in 2019 for an OTT platform and even though that project never came to fruition, the subject matter captured my curiosity way and beyond. Other than that, have experience in VFX, CGI, VR/AR and indulging in experimental projects, been interacting with Bitcoin and blockchains since 2010 + writing a movie script about it since 2013 with about 50 drafts on the subject matter, also touching upon topics like the metaverse and artificial intelligence.

### What is a Game?

> A formal model of an interactive situation. It typically involves several players; a game with only one player is usually called a decision problem. The formal definition lays out the players, their preferences, their information, the strategic actions available to them, and how these influence the outcome.
> 

The above application in the form of Video Games has been the fascination of the popular culture since its inception, not quite mainstream but always there through the decades becoming a staple of cultural investment in different generations as the technology became more and more accessible.

(…) The gaming industry has risen exponentially in the past few decades. In 2020, the global gaming industry's revenue was set to hit $165 billion, with 2.7 billion gamers worldwide today. The charts below explore how the industry has changed and grown since the 70s. From the large arcades of the 80’s and 90’s to consoles, PC to Smart Phones where we can complete multiple daily tasks on the same devices, playing games came as a natural time off everything around in the physical and virtual worlds.

### What is the difference between a traditional video game and a blockchain powered video game?

The basic principles of interactive game theory apply to both traditional and blockchain games alike though the difference is in the adaptation of the model that forms the core of development, monetization and governance.

A traditional video game is made by a developer, in some cases in partnership with a publisher or a platform acting as central parties that controls every aspect (as applicable in capitalist economies) of development. The primary motivation of a traditional video game is to provide interactive entertainment to the player in exchange for revenue under the following models:

These early days for blockchain powered games started to be known as the Play to Earn model where a player is participating with the core motivation of earning in-game tokens that can be exchanged for Fiat currencies outside the game via crypto exchanges like FTX or Coinbase.

By all practical means, current blockchains are limited in capabilities to host a full running game but in a few years down the line that will change i.e all activities of a player including play, transactions and governance could be recorded on a blockchain. This information can be interpreted by the rival players or anyone else with pros and cons but there are solutions already being deployed like Zero Knowledge Proofs to counter the loophole. Till we get back to the future, Play to Earn games are powered by blockchains via tokenomics.

The alpha of blockchain powered gaming is to understand that the metagame is not only monetization but game design.

### What is Gamification?

**Note: Majority of the behavioural economics for video games text here is from a detailed research by Mr. Weimin Toh and if you want to read his paper in full, a link can be found in the footer but for the relevant bits to the subject matter stay on course.

> “Decision-making is an important life skill. Video games can be leveraged to develop decision-making skills because they possess features such as multilinearity that require players to choose from among multiple options, and immediate feedback is provided to help players understand the outcomes of their choices.” Weimin Toh
> 

The financialization of our lives had already started happening as soon as credit cards were added to access digital services via app stores, while not completely apparent along with technology enabled gamification of society that rather than being played in the paper trails was now being played on mediums that are accessible to the masses. Aspects of these inner workings in the shadows have been looking for a way to break through, to be spelled out rather than operating from the darkness for the ultimate benefits of select individuals based on undemocratic curation models inherent to carry bias towards legacy protocols and money.

Based on the available literature, some of it in this proposal, we have a general understanding to establish that every game is already financialised and every economy is already gamified being played on a diverse apparatus of behavioural psychology. But to form a deeper understanding of the metagame below are some of the basic behavioural economic concepts applied while designing a gamification system:

### Return on Investment and Gratifications

> Behavioral economics applies psychological science to explain how people make economic decisions (Kamenica, 2012). The time-discounted utility theory is used in economics to describe subjective devaluation of outcomes as a function of time delay until delivery, where immediate rewards are more highly valued and more strongly influence our behavior than delayed rewards (Cai, Kim, & Lee 2011) -- especially for those who possess behavioral impulsivity and lower self-control (Jimura, Chushak, & Braver, 2013). Rewards are important factors that influence players’ decision-making in video games (Toh & Kirschner, 2020). Player behavior during gameplay is guided by reinforcement learning: where positive outcomes from a selected choice strengthen the stimulus-response connection, whereas negative outcomes weaken the connection (Toh & Kirschner, 2020). ***From a behavioral economics perspective, the utility function assumes decision-making is driven by the aim of maximizing utility, and that the utility function provides a way to quantify the subjective reward value the decision-maker attaches to each option (Elizabeth, Krishna, & Philippe, 2013).
> 

### Sunk Gain/Cost and Risk/Loss Aversion

> According to loss aversion in behavioral economics and decision theory, people tend to prefer avoiding losses to acquiring gains of the same value (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979; Brenner et al., 2007; Kahneman, 2011; Nguyen, 2016; Ruggeri et al., 2020). Loss aversion is related to the human preference to preserve the status quo against change (Gal, 2006), such as in cultural heritage preservation, where the most valuable parts of a cultural heritage must be conserved to benefit future generations (Holtorf, 2015). The loss aversion concept has also been found in stock investing (i.e., the disposition effect; Rau, 2014). Loss aversion describes the tendency for humans to continue investing in something that is not working (i.e., the sunk cost effect; Tykocinski & Ortmann, 2011; Magalhães & White, 2016). Studies (e.g., Polman, 2012) have also found that people who make choices for others reduces their loss aversion. ***When applying game theory, such as utility function and maximizing utility to game studies, it is worth noting that Kahneman’s work does not support the straightforward application of mathematical game theory to human decision making, as participants could also be influenced by other compounding factors -- such as their emotions or the game’s difficulty.
> 

### Scarcity of Resources

> Insufficient resources can contribute to a scarcity mindset and increase attention towards scarce resources, but at the cost of attention to unrelated aspects (Huijsmans et al., 2019). Prior research has examined how a scarcity mindset influences consumer decision-making. Shah, Shafir and Mullainathan (2015) argued that ***a scarcity mindset might render people more contemplative and, thus, less susceptible to external influences when making choices about resources.
> 

### Cost-benefit Analysis

> Cost-benefit analysis is an economics process that identifies, measures, and compares benefits and costs of an investment project or program (Campbell & Brown, 2016). A program involves a series of projects undertaken over time with a specific objective, whereas a project involves a proposed course of action that reallocates productive resources from their present use to undertake the project (Campbell & Brown, 2016). The reallocation of productive resources involves opportunity cost, which refers to the benefits (or value) that would have been produced had resources not been reallocated for other projects to produce other benefits for the decision-maker. ***When the player makes decisions during gameplay, the benefits of a decision usually need to be weighed against accompanying costs. Cost-benefit-based decision-making involves the binary decision to either accept or reject a choice according to two competing attributes: expected rewards and expected losses (Basten, Biele, Heekeren, & Fiebach, 2010).
> 

### Emotions and Economic Decision-making

> Economic decision-making models assume decision-makers can make choices by weighing the desirability (utility) and likelihood of their consequences (e.g., maximizing utility), and by integrating information into the decision-making process (Rick & Loewenstein, 2008). ***What happens, then, when actors don’t possess sufficient information and must make choices under uncertain conditions? Under such conditions, actors may be guided by their emotions (Lerner, Li, Valdesolo, & Kassam, 2015), intuitions, heuristics, prior experiences, biases (e.g., loss aversion) and personalities (Kahneman, 2011; Stojanović, 2013) -- especially when under time constraints.
>

### Considerations

There are theories ascertaining the above detailed points in more simplified concepts for video games like

> “(…) the concept of magic circles, first pioneered by Johan Huizinga way back in his 1938 book Homo Ludens and later expanded upon in the context of gaming by Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman in their 2003 book Rules of Play: Fundamentals of Game Design.” Delphi Digital, Future of (Crypto) Gaming.
> 

The most important thing I learned from the combination of theories is how the game is played while mostly guided by the design, might not always be interpreted as determined by the game developers but from the inclinations of the player’s curiosity as real world desires can take over the game play motivations.

Behavioural economics is at play on its own in early blockchain games because of the profit generation for the players in place at the origin. This has been discussed over many times with and without intentional understanding of the subject matter in various social conventions all of which is collectively stored along with Schrödinger's Cat in a Box of nature's unpredictability.

The challenge for an enthusiast of blockchain games is to construct an organic structure where underlying economic and governance elements become part of the default gameplay. This kind of metagame should fundamentally sustain its own economy even when the macroeconomic conditions outside the realm of the metaverse are not positively conducive for stability or growth.

# THE PROBLEM

Blockchain powered video games and gamification of society are at a convergence point known as the metaverse. These are early days with much of the focus on fun and play, however, as things develop more and more activities of everyday life will become part of this ecosystem. As much about the development of the technology, this would also be about the acceptance of a change in mindset, that at its core is already part of the underlying structure of governance across the world in different forms but there is no uniform interactive design to play this game in society.

For our purpose it is more relevant and sufficient to look at the problem from the context of the video game industry rather than from the perspective of international politics to lead the metaverse on a path of sustained growth while maintaining a macro equilibrium.

> “(…) We believe there is a lot of validity to many of the critiques that surfaced. Not just towards crypto (blockchain) gaming, but more broadly the evolution of the game industry’s core monetization practices over time.” Delphi Digital, Future of (Crypto) Gaming
> 

For being a technology based new platform in the video game industry, blockchain gaming has been going through some fluctuation as expected in all early stages of evolution to find a steady framework, structure and model.

A thought has been traveling among blockchain gaming developers that these games should be fun, that will solve the problem of mass adaptability. But I would argue that ‘fun’ is a completely subjective construct of a player’s behavioural motivations to build the foundation of the metaverse, if not of future society itself.

Much focus among developers and players of a Blockchain game is on making more money than they have actually invested, which is the real game of tokenomics, not only in the metaverse but also in reality and we shall circle back to that thought later in my proposed solution to design the metagame.

Another nugget of knowledge from perspective of game design in behavioural economics is real time or turn based strategy games:

### Economic Considerations and Game Types

> The game type may affect whether the player can focus on the economic decision-making during gameplay or whether other factors are more significant. ***In real-time strategy games such as Age of Empires, the economic principles such as investment, capital, diminishing returns to labor, cost and benefits of different technologies and scarcity of resources (Assa, 2013) are foregrounded in the decision-making process. In such games, players are tasked with gathering resources to develop an economy, and raising an army to defeat opposing forces.
> 

A constraint of most modern video/mobile games, even that are not powered by blockchains, are driven by technical design for monetization with player’s psychology and storytelling incorporated as an afterthought. Of course, we are grateful for the exceptions that are able to find the fine balance.

Monetization is extremely important to pay for the games development and to keep the player engaged in the play because every game play is inherently a competition through which a player gets relative reward, and it's this gap between the play and reward within the constraints where the fun element thrives, which is its own reward and satisfaction. Take into account this statement about Nintendo's popular video game, Super Mario Brothers, compared at different times of production:

> "A system whereby the value of the coin is directly related to player demand for the coins would not only allow for Nintendo to increase the value of the currency, but also for players to decide for themselves what value they place on the coins." Sir Gaulian
> 

When the above statement is read to an analogy of games powered by blockchain then the same logic is still applicable as in the conventional video games. The way to not make it a job but fun to play is to embrace the constraints of the play by turning them into an opportunity, to turn chaos into a magic circle of fun so as to not get caught in a scenario described below:

> "(Blockchain) Games had a rapid rise in 11/2017, when the famous game CryptoKitties was released. In a short period of time, players rushed into CryptoKitties for novelty, but soon, a large part of them found it did not meet their expectations and left. Hence, there is a steep decline after the peak." Survey Crypto Gaming*
> 

Blockchain monetisation for games needs to be different from traditional games because we are no longer only paying for continuous development of a game through an in-game economy but a decentralised economic system where assets, entities and coins/ tokens have real world value that is part of a thriving marco system.

Not every player participating in a video game can have a guaranteed or similar payout because that can not be fair, sustainable for a game’s economy or even fun for the players themselves. But at the same time you can not have a Lottery system applied either because those are extremely polarized and uncertain dynamics to develop an engaged game play with the following economic and player type considerations:

> The economic principles of wealth depreciation, taxation and unemployment do not exist in multi-player games such as Eve Online (Hooper, 2020). The lack of these economic principles in such online games helps to create a safe space for players; enabling them to stop playing whenever they choose without risking losing any in-game assets. However, wealth inequality exists in multi-player games such as Eve Online and is strongly correlated with the amount of time players have invested in the game (Hooper, 2020). ***The economic principle of return on investment is then important for the type of player who decides to invest more time into playing. The economic principle of return on investment can also manifest through pay-to-win features, or “microtransactions,” in online games (King & Delfabbro, 2019; King et al., 2020) in which players can not only pay to get immediate gratification by unlocking new game content (Salminen et al., 2018), but also to express their economic commitment in hopes of being acknowledged by other players for it (Nielsen, 2020). The economic principle of wealth inequality is also applicable to open world games, such as Minecraft. ***The study of player decision-making processes can occur on both the micro level of individual player choice, as well as on the macro level of Minecraft’s economy servers; in which all of the players’ respective wealth data is collected to understand the impact of unregulated economies on wealth inequality in-game (Blackwell & Carroll, 2018).
> 
> 
> According to Yee’s (2007) model, the achiever player type is defined as players who are driven to accrue power, rare items and collectibles in-game. *****Achievement is motivated by completion, which includes the desire to complete every mission, get every collectible and discover hidden things -- as well as power, which refers to the significance of becoming powerful in the game world.**
> 
> In contrast, the immersion player type is motivated by fantasy and story, as they become immersed in a story with an elaborate storyline and interesting characters. (…) The economic consideration of loss aversion may be more important to them, as their decision-making was driven by a need to preserve their relationships with characters they were connected to; *****as well as avoiding losing characters whom they had become emotionally invested in. However, this does not mean that other economic considerations, such as cost-benefit analysis, were not applicable to these players, just that they were less important.**
> 

If we take the human element of behavioural psychology out of the equation for a moment, then are we looking to build an autonomous technical structure embedded into an organic revenue generation machine learning model? Such a model would still be using behaviour psychology to continue its need to evolve and develop through winning loops to not let the game play become monotonous, just keep in mind that machines are made to be monotonous by design to account for human impulsiveness. The point being that behaviour psychology and monetisation are vital in any game theory model and by default in any metagame.

### **Blockchain Gaming**

Axie Infinity represents the most popular and successful blockchain game around which most of the emerging blockchain games are taking as an example for structuring their in-game economies. This chart below is the good measure of the Axie’s economic model:

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee0ba870-a055-403d-8923-c675371d5f0f_1600x865.png)

At first glance, this model seems robust and based on the calculations in the below figure at its peak makes one of the strongest economies in the world, not only a gaming economy based only on monthly average guaranteed income it can generate for the participating players:

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F64d2567f-0f34-4928-8a99-539523410883_1600x921.png)

However, the following observation is where blockchain games like Axie face their biggest challenge under the current model as examined in here

> “Breeding a team of 3 Axies wins approximately 67 days for the Axie economy, after the 67th day, the player becomes a liability for the Axie economy as the economy now needs to finance that player infinitely. For every new player (every 3 newly minted/bred Axies), 5.4k SLP is burnt immediately but 30k SLP will be minted in the next 1 year and 150k SLP in the next 5 years.” Defi Vader
> 

Following is the summarisation of primary limitations in the Axie Infinity’s game design model:

1. The game play is designed with the motivation to generate token based revenue both counter or counter clockwise.
2. Lack of design to empower players for exploration of their natural behaviour.
3. Only financial or limited real life and virtual character interoperability.
4. Unsustainable economic design dependent upon a large number of Macroeconomic conditions.

These are not new challenges as similar difficulties have been arising for traditional game developers, however, tokens having real world value accentuates the issue and requires a fresh design approach to think of the constraints as an opportunity.

### **Regular Games**

*There’s an* argument to put “normal” video games on the blockchain. Sure, for hobby’s sake and as a skills enhancement exercise that sounds interesting. However, we can already play a “normal” video game everywhere else and putting it on any of the current blockchains shall only diminish that experience.

### **PlayFi**

> Ultimately, crypto is primarily going to serve as the backend accounting engine that facilitates ticketing, payments, player NFT contracts (on-chain reputation), automated tournament bounty smart contracts, and so on. Crypto unlocks new transparency around player profiles, a deep liquidity layer facilitating seamless payments, and new ways for people to bet without navigating burdensome infrastructure. Furthermore, many properties of crypto technology such as digital provenance unlock a new way to think about the digital realm.” Delphi Digital’s, Future of (Crypto) Gaming report.
> 

The above section is taken from the mentioned report which is filled with valuable points and a must read for education about gaming in general and current developments in blockchain gaming.

The PlayFi model is already out there and successful for monetisation in pro sports and esports leagues as detailed in the report itself. That said, this is probably the line between crypto gaming and blockchain powered games building with the principles of decentralisation. The model used in pro sports and sports entertainment even though extremely lucrative is known to be exploitative in favour of central parties. This is not about belief but data, part of which can be found here to start with but is prevalent for leagues in football, MMA and other sports< https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/dec/11/football-transfers-rife-with-illegality-and-exploitation-report-money-laundering-third-party-ownership-uefa

The crypto model can in fact improve upon these exploitative practices of the legacy leagues by creating and committing to decentralisation though is an uphill battle as any sports based video games would like to be associated with the established leagues/ organizations for a chance at success as its a zero sum game competing with them for market share. It becomes a game of marketing competition as the primary driver for monetisation rather than the core game could be unsustainable creatively and fall into a repetitive loop.

> “For example, let’s look at the bracket below which has a total of 8 entry-level slots. Each of these starting points could be sold in a primary auction, and then trade freely on the secondary market without impacting the core gameplay. The smart contracts representing the prize pool might take 50% of all revenues generated (in addition to sponsors), further contributing to the appeal of the competition.” Delphi Digital, The Future of (Crypto) Gaming.
> 

I don’t agree with the statement that the auction and then selling of the slots in the secondary market is not impacting the core game play. The argument that similar exploitative monetisation inside the core game in a direct transaction should be regarded as a corrupt practice but is acceptable if happening from a secondary market with chances of major influence of third parties is contradictory. Maybe its due to lack of understanding of the complete model which currently seems ripe for shadow play and centralisation. I would like to make a complete opinion upon further study.

> "The economic proposition in the case of collectibles is quite a simple one; they must have some value to the player, usually beyond the simple act of attaining it." Sir Gaulian
> 

As a side note, would also like to mention ZEBEDEE:

> The ZEBEDEE Platform is a high-throughput payment processor built natively on Bitcoin. ZEBEDEE empowers Bitcoin-enabled digital economy engines to thrive inside digital experiences. With ZEBEDEE, you can actually bring money into the fabric of your game or online experience and allow for meaningful economic interaction to occur — from game to gamer, from gamer to game, or even gamer to gamer.
> 

I have to study this in more detail though it seems to be closely related to the PlayFi model but they are only providing API for organisation or a group of gamers can build their prize pool or reward mechanism on Bitcoin.

### **Understanding Governance**

> *The below is not criticism of Voting as a right and has nothing to do with real world politics. It’s only used as a ref point in context of the subject matter about making in video game consensus easier as a process.*
> 

A vital function in blockchain powered decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO)'s governance is Consensus Voting. We are all pretty much familiar with the concept of voting, which might be the biggest meta power of any democratic system and yet it's the biggest variable illusion. A process skewed towards fulfilling every politician’s wet dream of getting consensus while its flaws hidden in perception of freewill becoming a tool for manipulation. 

Voting is the most practical application of game theory in the real world but played out completely in the shadows and consistently creating long term exploitation; how does on chain voting solve any problem that is persistent with general voting other than % of authentic votes unless the metagame of persuasion and later execution also plays out on chain? There are protocols trying to find an equilibrium through tokenization and penalties but it's a hard problem to solve.

Expecting absolute transparency and fairness is somewhat of an idealistic perspective which might never be completely in play unless at some point in the future humanity’s governance has transitioned into automated systems- a point of massive debate unless we are talking about something called a blockchain and a fictional video game for now.

Before the next point, consider this: If a marco system is a sum of its parts, can the parts also sample the marco mechanism of the sum while still performing independently?

### What is consensus in terms of a blockchain?

> “Consensus mechanisms (also known as consensus protocols or consensus algorithms) allow distributed systems (networks of computers) to work together and stay secure.
> 
> 
> *Consensus protocols and consensus algorithms are often used interchangeably. However, protocols and algorithms are different. A protocol is a set of rules defined in a standard that governs how a system and its many functioning parts operate and interact. Algorithms are like exact recipes on how to solve a problem or calculate a result.*
> 
> (..) proof-of-work and proof-of-stake are not consensus protocols by themselves, but they are often referred to as such for simplicity. They are actually Sybil resistance mechanisms and block author selectors; they are a way to decide who is the author of the latest block. It's this Sybil resistance mechanism combined with a chain selection rule that makes up a true consensus mechanism.*”*4

### **What is not Metaverse?**

Before we take a deep dive into the mechanics of the metagame let’s consider some notions that are forced upon the narrative of being essential for the metaverse with the understanding that the metaverse itself is not essential, none of this is except for love. But we are locked in time and realistically speaking it only moves in one direction towards entropy, though, as my late friend Bill Hicks will say..here’s Tom with the weather:

1. Metaverse is not a 3d garden of virtual avatars teleporting into the abyss- think about one thing from your daily routine which would be better i.e performed more efficiently by consuming less of your time + effort if staged in a virtual 3d environment. Practical education i.e skills or concepts based on the rate of information consumed per frame divided by the quality with which it is delivered in terms of interactiveness and relevance directly correlates to being better in virtual and augmented reality than the current education system. Now, think again, is it less to do with 3d but more with interactiveness? Too much information can also cause brain drain, frequency of delivery is just as important as the mode of delivery.
    
    I have been working with 3d objects for 15 years and they already have amazing use cases, great for interactivity; it's just not the primary selling point of the metaverse. Reality is already projected in 3d, we do everything in three dimensions with fresh air and mostly a nice smell.
    
    E-commerce is pushed as a big use case for 3d Models but will it ever be cheaper compared with a good photograph and also consider per unit marketing cost of majority online goods? It could be the primary visualisation to sell in certain high end categories though difficult to ascertain as the predominant device for sales in the foreseeable future.
    
    From my assumption based on cost and effect whether using 2d or 3d, Augmented Reality shall bring the best of both worlds by blending them with Real time information, Interactiveness and indulgence being more essential to The Metaverse than 3d.
    
2. Trillion Dollar Organisations (TDO)- Not to generalise but experts love these entities as they can constantly cover up the gaps in the abyss of the corporate structures. I tried being an expert but failed, being terrible at disregarding my passion for authentic use cases also meant selling with healthy scepticism which does not work in adrenaline ruled hyperactive political environments therefore had to keep improving my skills of understanding a subject matter to better explain the value of thinking in terms of long term working design/ use case compared to short term monetization drives. Beyond that rant; each TDO’s might have its own characteristics, however, every function can be interpreted as game play which is designed to be interactive in a small and closed circle where meta is not only hidden but also inaccessible from majority of the players. For example quoting this tweet from Paul Graham:

> “Wow, something of a bombshell in this interview. I always wondered why Microsoft raised venture funding. They didn't need it. The VC involved hypothesizes it was partly because Ballmer wanted to be sure he got the equity he'd been promised. https://t.co/QUfxHNnDGB”
> 

Let's be real; nothing wrong with earning money from the current models like nothing wrong with being an expert but when a better model presents itself to design a more uniformly decentralised and efficient system, what should an expert do? History converges with the future in the present when we have a better working solution. I am making an assumption based on the arguments presented in this introduction and elsewhere in favour of a metaverse moving away from corporate hierarchies, towards decentralised ownership within a developing blockchain architecture.

1. Can’t think of a third point! It’s not essential…!!! But here’s a tweet from Vitalik Buterin to debunk the corporate perception of the metaverse:

> “The "metaverse" is going to happen but I don't think any of the existing corporate attempts to intentionally create the metaverse are going anywhere.”
> 

How to make an open and utility based metaverse with healthy behavioural psychology as touched upon above without relying on any association to enforce the standards or a corporate over-governance from the shadows?

## PROPOSED METAGAME

***Note: Majority of the Game Theory text and maths here is from a detailed research titled CDAM Research Report LSE-CDAM-2001-09 and if you want to read the paper in full, a link can be found in the footer but for the relevant bits to the subject matter stay on course.

The primary considerations while designing the metagame are to establish a relatively autonomous, self sustainable virtual economy with decentralised governance in the context of a blockchain powered multiplayer strategy game that broadens the scope for real time interactive storytelling as a utility.

### What is the use of game theory in designing the Metagame?

> “Game theory is the formal study of conflict and cooperation. Game theoretic concepts apply whenever the actions of several agents are interdependent. These agents may be individuals, groups, firms, or any combination of these. ***The concepts of game theory provide a language to formulate, structure, analyze, and understand strategic scenarios.
> 
> 
> The internal consistency and mathematical foundations of game theory makes it a prime tool for modeling and designing automated decision-making processes in interactive environments…*****The automation of strategic choices enhances the need for these choices to be made efficiently, and to be robust against abuse. Game theory addresses these requirements.**
> 
> As a mathematical tool for the decision maker the strength of game theory is the methodology it provides for structuring and analyzing problems of strategic choice. *****The process of formally modeling a situation as a game requires the decision maker to enumerate explicitly the players and their strategic options, and to consider their preferences and reactions.** The discipline involved in constructing such a model already has the potential of providing the decision maker with a clearer and broader view of the situation. *****This is a “prescriptive” application of game theory, with the goal of improved strategic decision making.“**
> 

Every kind of game including video games are designed using the game theory as the core building block, therefore, in essence metagame would be a practical visualisation of a complete process in context of the game theory with interactive input and output for every move and function.

> "Like it or not, every video game has an in-game economy and whether it be collectables, coins or currency, or loot; each and every decision a designer makes to encourage people to act or behave (or not) in a certain way is driven by conventional or behavioural economics." Sir Gaulian
> 

If we unwrap the above observational statement made in context of Super Mario Brothers it can be deduced a game designer is transferring the object of his strategy as game play for the player to make a choice which directly impacts the in game economy and by effect the designer’s own choices with time spent and revenue generated from the play as the accountability metric, therefore, every choice a player makes inside a game is a meta as well. Based on this we can refine the statement to reflect that ‘Like it or not, every game already has an in-built metagame.’ But only with partial interactive play in current models of both traditional and blockchain powered games.’

The difference between traditional video game platforms and Blockchain powered games is that the latter provides an elemental framework for gamification of the complete metagame design subjective to each game which is not essential to make an entertaining or successful video game but is imperative for a sustainable blockchain powered video game= The Metaserve.

### Architecture Overview

Metagame is designed to be played between 3 primary entities, each with multiple players indulged in the respective core games.

The approach is driven by a simple concept to decentralise the structure from inside out, based on separating 3 interdependent operating layers on every level:

- Developer
- Governance
- Participants

Let’s simulate our imagination with the below diagrams in context of game design. Shoutout to Jack Butcher of Visualise Value for inspiring the aesthetics for these diagrams.

Two primary gameplay that form a metagame to play against each other:

![Figure 2- METAGAME 1 DEVELOPER AND GOVERNANCE](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e6939ee-b997-4ae5-a778-ecba59ea238f_1140x1140.png)

Figure 2- METAGAME 1 DEVELOPER AND GOVERNANCE

- the developer and the governance- Extensive games with perfect information:
    
    > “In an extensive game with perfect information, every player is at any point aware of the previous choices of all other players. Furthermore, only one player moves at a time, so that there are no simultaneous moves.”
    > 

![Figure 3- METAGAME 2 GOVERNANCE AND CONSUMER](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15da3f8d-860f-42c4-b657-4c80fde8693a_1002x1002.png)

Figure 3- METAGAME 2 GOVERNANCE AND CONSUMER

- the governance and the participants- Extensive games with imperfect information:
    
    > “Extensive games with imperfect information model exactly which in- formation is available to the players when they make a move. Modeling and evaluating strategic information precisely is one of the strengths of game theory.”
    > 

Out of the three entities in this game, two of them at respective ends of the spectrum shall never directly play against each other, therefore, multiple mixed strategies and equilibriums are at play.

> An equilibrium is defined by a (possibly mixed) strategy for each player where no player can gain on average by unilateral deviation. Average (that is, expected) payoffs must be considered because the outcome of the game may be random.
> 

A metagame is not a perfect system, in fact I would assume it should be developed as an imperfect system that might fail a lot as long as it's indulging. The instances where it works shall be pure awesomeness in organic but also interactive progression of the core game’s design and play. As represented by Figure 1 that is made of uneven level design with minimum probability of reaching equilibrium is an imperfect game.

![Figure 1- METAGAME UNEVEN LEVEL DESIGN*](METAGAME%20OF%20THE%20METAVERSE%E2%80%94%20Research%20afe1846a24df4222bb3a51d4eb798ef6/03CBD411-762D-4C83-85D4-45D9D7C618F1.png)

Figure 1- METAGAME UNEVEN LEVEL DESIGN*

In a video game reaching equilibrium could be the point for leveling up or at the end of the game itself, it's like a draw in chess, you always have a move left but do you want to make it for the most desirable result or maintain your current position? But in a Metagame maintaining equilibrium outside the core game is the primary design requirement at every level between the developer and governance, governance and participants for an healthy economy.

> If a game has more than one Nash equilibrium, a theory of strategic interaction should guide players towards the “most reasonable” equilibrium upon which they should focus. Indeed, a large number of papers in game theory have been concerned with “equilibrium refinements” that attempt to derive conditions that make one equilibrium more plausible or convincing than another.
> 

Core play could be more indulging in spite of the duplicity of the equilibrium gameplay but would not always mean financial fulfilment for an individual which shall result in lack of steady governance to maintain sustainable resources for smooth functioning, most likely resulting in a failed economy and collapse of the metaverse.

![Figure 4- METAGAME WITH MIXED EQUILIBRIUM](METAGAME%20OF%20THE%20METAVERSE%E2%80%94%20Research%20afe1846a24df4222bb3a51d4eb798ef6/65901E76-E2D5-43AD-9FE7-0EF19F7F1FB9.png)

Figure 4- METAGAME WITH MIXED EQUILIBRIUM

> In a sense, the payoffs in a game mimic a player’s (consistent) willingness to bet when facing certain odds. With respect to the payoffs, which may distort the monetary amounts, players are then risk neutral. Such payoffs are also called expected-utility values. Expected-utility functions are also used in one-player games to model decisions under uncertainty. This dependence of mixed equilibrium probabilities on the opponent’s payoffs can be explained in terms of population dynamics.
> 

### What does it mean to find mixed equilibrium in context of the metagame?

Storytelling is mentioned as a utility because in an infinite open world the only way to keep the core game play of interactive strategy fresh and organically evolving is for a story to be seen from multiple perspectives and not fall for monetization as the only outcome of the competitiveness; its uniform decentralization of the gameplay for all entities across the metagame to complement the technical decentralisation of the entity layers.

# Call For Action

Even though the concept of metagame has been developing in my mind for years, I had given myself two week to write this introduction and it was important to make it a step by step time bound process to get started so as to not get overwhelmed by the scope that needs more resources and undivided attention over a long period of time. There are many aspects of behavioural economics I want to explore in detail along with ideas to incorporate core blockchain mechanisms currently being operated and governed from outside the metaverse that can be brought inside the metagame thesis like staking or proof of work. Next step:

- A working metagame design document- this would mean a working blockchain based video game could be developed from this blueprint.

*I did not touch upon the history of the metaverse; who, what and how we need it or not; ‘the purpose of dancing is to dance and not to look for its meaning’ Alan Watts. If you have to fill that void then google it or if you are interested i recommend a book called The Metaverse by Matt Ball. Talking about game theory; is every strategist also an opportunist because most strategies are only a temporary deviation from the outcome? First thing is to forget everything you have learned about the metaverse till now. That is not going to be easy… so take a vacation to mars…..with Elon Musk, come back with a bottle of red wine to read this proposal from that point onwards. Also, send 0.05 BTC on bc1qmdmml0fn0yqe5m6mjuyjrwcjjm9eu3wja6sksf or 0.5 ETH on 0xBA011F691125fa554f0153abcac579d170fa9877. Jokes are important for any kind of verse except the call to send Bitcoin or Ethereum which is not a joke and a good practice anyway if you want to think again, like a monk, do that work.*
