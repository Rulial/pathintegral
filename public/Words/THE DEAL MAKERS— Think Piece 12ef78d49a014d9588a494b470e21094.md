Why a banana with coconut tress as the background cover?

The science of making deals in itself is a never ending subject but for the purpose of this essay we'll only be discussing the art. It's indeed an art of pure imagination and the world around is the generated output. Call it a painting, a movie or whatever you want, as long as the deal makers can benefit from the transaction, making sense does not even matter. Though, one is incomplete without the other for useful outcomes in any effective way.

Maybe, I should start by giving you some historical examples of fantastic deal making from around the world but there are too many to only pick a single one. Instead of discussing any particular deal or its form, we are going to be using hypothetical examples to explore the fundamental nature of this tool set, related skill set and what makes a deal maker? 

Rest shall be upto your imagination and hopefully useful in making or taking better deals “1 + 1 = 3” ~Dave Trott.

I am a firm believer in the science of capitalism as realistically the only long term economic mechanism for a sustainable society—> important to state this clearly so there's no confusion or intentional misinterpretation of the text in this essay.

A consequence of the information age is more and more people reading whatever they want to read rather than what is written as out sourcing of thinking is more common than breathing clean air. People get offended by those pointing out the polluted outdoors rather than by those polluting the environment as there's a deal waiting for them somewhere in the smoke and mirrors.

We can divide all deals into 3 broad categories—>

1. Short Term
2. Regular
3. Long Term

We are all deal takers varying through a spectrum of these categories but those clueless about these filters unknowingly juggle between the short term and regular deals, the ones without any options are by default only able to take whatever is available in the regular category, while a great deal maker is always aware about the categorical aspect of any deal in the context of their desired outcome and optimize based on the goals. Each category is also a broad spectrum of its own rather than being a singular point on a sphere depicted as the domain of any said deal.

Let's say you are out of soap or shower gel or whatever it is used to clean yourself, its out there in the market and you are not going to be much surprised by the available options, there's no room for negotiation, its all set. Go to the shop, pick whatever from a range which suits your pocket, pay the cost and start using it—> it's a regular deal. You don't want to spend an hour, a day, a week on buying a damn soap, if you were insulted for being in the regular category, well don't! Regular category is desirable for most products, it's a feature, not a bug as such regular deals make everyone's lives easier + maybe, should add…..enjoyable.

Magic soap did not find the shelf on its own though, its not a unique soap either, it's made for you and through a form of mass deal that in variable degrees benefits everyone else involved in the process right down to the consumer. This form of deals are well studied in economics + other related subjects and implemented to a point that there's not much room for the art in regular deals.

Most possibilities for the deal makers to show their artistic talent lies in the short and long terms.
Forget about the spectrum of deals for a moment and look at it's nature—> either you are making a completely independent deal or its a string of regularised short term deals leading to a long term outcome. The independent deal doesn’t necessarily needs to be defined in immediate terms, maybe it plays out in a day, a month or a year but it is reliant on a one shot prize while the latter is about building an ecosystem. There's room and usefulness for both in respective ways.

The soap that costs 10, let's say someone found a way to make that same soap for 5, taking a hypothetical flat rate currency. But the material they are going to use to make the soap is not produced in any quantity sustainable for mass produce. This means there would need to be substantial investment in the short term that will pay itself off in the long term because of profit margin, therefore—> gains.

Just as the manufacturer is able to find potential suitors for this magic soap, another snag unravels, potentially presenting a major dilemma. By the way, making soap is unlikely to be this complicated, just taking the most relatable HYPOTHETICAL example—> keep that in mind, none of this is related to any particular industry, country, people or profession 🤗

The material to make this magic soap needs to be extracted from a special crop of raw banana leafs in massive quantities and the only way to do this viably is intensive farming methods which is sure as the sun will rise, is not good for the soil or the local environment. The owners of the magic soap company need to lease a massive piece of land but it is not the easiest thing in the world, even though at the onset this seemed like the least of their problems.

Magic soap company starts approaching various states in a federally structured country for a land deal with apparently a lot of money in their pocket and they need to make this happen. They have a plan to mitigate the risk to the environment in the long term though it can't be guaranteed by any scientific means. There's pressure on the owners from the suitors funding this whole project and to not make the deal would be a tremendous setback.

They finally find a suitable land to grow the special bananas and are about to sign the agreement with the local government to secure the lease as this will generate employment along with long term positive sentiments. However, to get things done in this hypothetical state, you not only need to convince the people in power but also deal with various stakeholders in the region including the opposition which the magic soap owners completely ignore at first! Therefore, the word spreads in the local population about the potential adverse impacts of banana plantation to the local environment, leading to a major backlash and a hurdle in finalising the lease to the point where it seems like the deal might have to be canceled.

A great deal maker never gives up on a good deal though even when they should as the magic soap owners learn that no one in the region shall object if they just use the land to grow coconut trees instead of banana trees.

"But we need banana leafs for the product?" Asks a member of the team
"Exactly, we need banana leafs, not banana trees." Magic soap owner
"Banana leafs grow on banana trees. What am i missing?" A member of the team
"Well, who says we can't grow banana leafs on coconut trees?" Magic soap owner

A cat is standing below barbed wire fencing staring with unique curiosity at what seems like a coconut tree farmland from the outside. He finally crosses the fencing and ventures inside the farm.

A little girl comes running behind the cat, she wants to take the cat and leave though just then can't help but notice all the banana trees from what looked like a coconut farmland at first. The kitty is getting agitated, the little girl grabs her tighter and runs away.

It might seem like things worked out for the magic soap company though was that a good deal in the long term? Not really. Almost everyone in this hypothetical satire is making unethical choices for short term gains when any serious enterprise should try to avoid such artful deals. 

Such options do keep presenting themselves more frequently as looking into the future is impossible, calculating future is still improbable and our natural tendency of grabbing whatever’s in front easily takes over. 

Difficult to avoid these instincts even though not politically right to admit—> the art of making deals is never a simplistic choice between right or wrong but the choice most in sync with humanistic values and infinite other options based on the deal maker’s abilities to gauge from a given position.

Still, important to remember that unethical, unsustainable loop holes appearing as interim solutions are actually traps, if not leading to black than various shades of grey swans because….. no matter what, we can't cheat nature.
