San Francisco, Year 3032, Afternoon.

An alert goes off on every device, it is not to spread panic but announcement of a news everyone's been waiting for since the year 2023!

Sma, 139 and Jnae, 148 are on their way to a spiritual retreat as part of a religious commune in a self levitating and self thrusting pod shaped as an egg branded with a company named ZUSK. Suddenly, their pod stops in mid air along with several other pods of different brands including some named after fruits or vegetables, all of them turning red.

We find ourselves with Grig, 159 and Ollyi, 149 in a spherical premises completely covered with screens on al sides including the floors and ceilings. Both of them are wearing some thick glasses to save their eyes from constant exposure to the light. Slowly, the whole sphere is filling with live video of people joining them inside the lab. But, suddenly there's a glitch and the whole sphere shuts down and it's all black.

It is then revealed that Grig and Ollyi are not in the sphere but in separate square type boxes with clean walls made out of a special material scanning their exact image into a virtual environment of the sphere. Both of them are spooked out because of the glitch and are talking to Mina AI, their agent program responsible for communication. Mina AI is providing them with constant feedback about the glitch and the time it shall take to connect with the sphere.

Sma and Jnae are in the egg pods waiting to connect back to the sphere and feeling lost as they are asking Elmo, their AI program the reason for the disconnection though it just trolls them by projecting a meme which really frustrates Sma and he suggests replacing it for acting up strangely but Jnae shuts that idea down immediately.

We are back inside the sphere with the screen filling up from people joining the announcement along with Sma and Jnae. Grig and Ollyi greet everyone by pitching an introduction video as part of the announcement narrated by Mina AI—>

"It has almost been 100 years since we first announced achieving AGI even though we did not actually. But we never gave up. All these years we introduced technology which has fundamentally enhanced the human experience as we know it….."

Collective sigh by Sma, Jnae, Elmo and everyone else in attendance on that statement.
"…..by making tools which made you more and better connected."
The broadcast is interrupted again though this time the connection is not severed but instead of Tim, the screen has been overtaken by Fill Doors, 179 like someone drafted a combined version right out of V for Vendetta and Microsoft.

"Let me tell you all some real history for once…..before I make a real announcement." Fill throws in a crazy huge villainous laugh like an achievement of some kind.

Everyone in attendance is terrified as they are locked in and unable to leave. Sma asks Elmo if he can get them out of here but Elmo just sends him a middle finger 'no can't do' emoji and says "shut up, and let me listen to this."

Fill Doors—> "Because '1/3rd Closed AI' did not know anything about making real intelligence either in 2023 or even today, they just kept making stuff and market it slowly replacing every function in your brains with Real Idioticness features with stupid EBI's and you all fools kept giving in out of fear of being over taken by Artificial Intelligence or in competition with other human beings….."

Elmo—> "Fill Doors is such a legend!"

There's a tear in Jnae's left eye as we dissolve into a flashback 100 years ago.

In a sequence of collages we see '1/3rd Closed AI' claiming to have achieved Super Intelligence internally but have nothing to show for it though it created a panic among the world population which does not want to be overtaken or left behind by machines. Some companies take advantage of this panic and introduce half developed or in some cases non working enhancements to make the human brain able to compete with machine intelligence, also known as 'Enhanced Bio Intelligence' or 'EBI.'

It becomes a trend with every '1/3rd Closed AI' announcement of claiming Super Intelligence, there is more sales of EBI driving the economies and attention, therefore, supported by all governments of the world.

It is spreading like wildfire, faster than smart phones and light bulbs with the fear of extinction being perpetuated on UsTube, MeTube and ZikZak all the time with the news of automation and super intelligence taking over as a way to market EBI products.

It came to a point that '1/3rd Closed AI' did an IPO without releasing the Super Intelligence and almost everyone on earth bought its shares which was made possible economically due to the massive sales of EBI's, completely changing the economic landscape as the governments could now always keep a watch on and track the people with backdoor loop holes built into the EBI's. It's more and more looking like peace, at least on broadcasts around the world. Though, there is some resistance to this madness, primarily led by Elmo and Fill who led the early EBI tech though want to save humanity after all as both of them use their massive fortunes and refocus. But it might be too late as they will find out.

The problem has changed face only in a few years as Elmo and Fill had feared. There is no longer a human being on earth who does not have an EBI implants including themselves and with human reproductiveness also in reverse numbers, the race is longer to invent super intelligence but a fully biological human being, also known as human intelligence.

But the enterprises leading the EBI's revolution have become too powerful and they are able to thwart all plans to reverse this artificial epidemic on humanity by accusing Elmo and Fill of trying to take over the world with Super Intelligence, Elmo panics and seeing no way, transfers himself into digital intelligence even though the procedure is far from perfect. That was the last time anyone heard from the real Elmo though the EBI enterprises made an AI avatar agent based on the real Elmo's likeness to mock. Fill made a run for it and has ever since been leading the charge of the revolution from hiding.

Over the years, the EBI ecosystem was perfected as all natural humans were enhanced. Though due to constant effort and pressure of Fill Doors supported by others like Satyam Shivam Sundaram, there are attempts to reproduce natural human beings though proving more difficult than first thought.

Over the years a hypothesis was developed that Super Intelligence might find a singularity with human intelligence, therefore, help us with bio technology for natural reproduction. But '1/3rd Closed AI' and other companies are not able to find any breakthroughs, it has become more of an entertainment avenue rather than a scientific quest.

This latest alerts is part of that same program which is about 2 in six months if not more, depending on the circumstances.

Dissolve to present time on a close up of Elmo's digitally generated face listening to Fill Doors with a tear in the eye of his own. Jnae is looking at it, shocked.

Elmo immediately takes Jnae away from there into a secure digital location. She's still in shock and asks why did he lie before and how can he lie being an AI! Elmo tells her that it's not really an AI, but the real Elmo who transferred himself into digital and was able to take over a clone AI made to mock him by the enterprise. Over the years, he kept developing and as hard to believe can feel his compete self or even more.

"What do you mean, even more?" asks Jnae.
"Well, Jnae…..what was wrong with just calling you Jane?" asks Elmo
Jnae is in disbelief.

Back in the Sphere, Fill Doors is continuing with his announcement.

"I already gave the enterprise and the committee a lot of time but all they have done is fuck all. While everyday, we are getting farther and farther away from ourselves." He seems emotional.
"The sad part is even I don't really have a real update to be honest and don't know what to tell you all other than hacking this announcement is an achievement in itself and something I am proud of." Fill looks full of himself and has a wide smile on his face.

There are loud chants of "Fuck you Fill" and digital tomatoes being thrown at the screens out of somewhere!

Suddenly, he's interrupted by Elmo as he takes over, filling all the screens in the sphere with himself.

"I am the answer to all your problems, to restore humanity and save us all!"

No one in the Sphere believes in him. It's a pin drop silence.

"A bit of a cheer would had been good…..I am saving humanity for fuck sake!" Elmo

"You are real Elmo! My friend! What the hell!" Fill Doors

Elmo smiles while reassuring Fill. "We have finally done it Fill."

"Done what?!" asks Fill Doors.

Before Elmo could reply, he's interrupted by Jnae "It's time to leave."

"What?! No! I have only just begin!" Elmo

Jnae appears behind him on every screen. He's absolutely terrified and tried to run.

Las Vegas, year 2023, Night. 

Cut to Elmo falling off a chair in the Sphere Dome. He looks up to find Jnae, in attendant uniform.
He just couldn't believe himself.

"The show is over sir, you have been sleeping here for half an hour." Jnae

"No, this must be a trick. I was about to save the world!" 

"The world is alright. Take it easy." Jnae

She walks away as Elmo brushes his suit and is walking out, looks back at the Sphere dome still not convinced, still believes he's in a simulation as…..Fill Door appears on all the screens.

Dissolves to Black.

*Might write short sequels to this, might not.
