# Current Affairs FAQ—> Let’s set the record straight

If I am going to write about world affairs, especially about AI development then my position needs to be clear and present about certain geo political issues concerning humanity.

The following status about the said issues will remain as below unless updated otherwise. Any conflicting like or repost on any Social media should only be regarded as gathering information for the purpose of analysis.

There’s a massive difference between liberal values > liberal ideology. Earlier is driven by care for civilisation, whilst liberal ideology powers its politics—> exploiting sentiments for short term gains to look good, rather than developing earnest, often difficult solutions.

Conservative values compliments it’s ideology—> politics are about keeping things as they supposedly were, familiarity makes it relatable—> lever of control. Whilst any thought put towards improving nature of the universal values made to look rigid, unnecessary and fearsome.

That’s why right and left are connected by the centre, it’s not a neutral position, but the place of most friction—> therefore, epicentre of sensible ideas and progress. Not easily relatable by either side as its uncomfortable always trying to find the equilibrium.

FAQ has no sarcasm.

### **Russia / Ukraine**

I have been to Russia 4x times and in love with the ironclad intention of getting married to Ms. Anna Chukova of Tver after our chance meeting at a hotel in Mumbai, India. You can find more about our relationship by reading detailed account on notion—> [@WORDS](../../Words%E2%80%94%20Long%20Form%2033d9afdc37704ab3ad9cc30c800d8674.md).

I am against the war. Not only this, but all wars. It’s the worst kind of communication between two or more parties.

I love Russian culture and accept their history without judgement, and in admiration of the bright spots. Same for Ukraine.

The issue was not handled well by any side, whether it’s Europe, UK, USA or Ukraine, but more importantly by Mr. Putin, President of Russian Federation as the war was initiated on his orders, and may I add misjudgement.

Macro understanding of international politics can only be based on interpretation of the relative micro details and vague sub factors. As we only know what’s in the news and rest is about connecting the dots whilst the real battles are being fought on an entirely different pane of reality. I like to understand subjects from a diplomatic perspective of striving for peace at any cost, rather than from a combative or an unnecessarily opposing position.

Conquest for more land when we are developing technologies to make other planets in our solar system habitable sounds archaic focus on ego, rather than mindfulness. At the same time, Europe’s insecurity about intentions of Russia, to keep pushing a sensitive issue also sounds like a solution looking for a problem. Here we are after 2+ years of war and countless lives lost of innocent people who likely had no other option.

These issues would not have surfaced if Kremlin had taken a more democratic approach to power and rule. Keeping in mind no one lives forever, therefore no one can rule forever either. It’s better to have strong systems and capable people at every level. Also, Importance of democracies is established by fair elections on relevant issues, without needing the showcase of wars as a realisation.

It’s much better to play with economic cycles, rather than cycles of violence.

I am not following minute details of this war, though it seems to be going nowhere and being carried on for the sake of somehow finding a winner.

Ukraine has already shown its resilience and has a moral victory of standing up to a much more powerful state in Russia.

Russia has also shown that it can sustain in spite of all the sanctions and against alignment of major powers. It should not hurt Russia’s ego that it’s in no position to fight the NATO, its reality and not world of Warcraft. Why does it even need to take on the NATO in the battlefield? Why not focus on strengthening the economy which was in a good state before all this idioticness?! Like I mentioned before, international politics can be messy and we won’t try to make sense.

My love life and the world would be a better place by putting an end to this war—> restoring peace. Ukraine and Russia would be better for their people by restoration of fair democratic practices to avoid the cycles of turmoil. Mr. Putin needs to stop looking at adoption of fair democratic practices as a loss to the west, but as a win for the Russian people.

### **Israel/ Gaza, Iran, Lebanon—> the Middle East Saga**

Talking about messy, where do we even begun on this one?

I am not going to be debating history in this essay. 100 years ago was history, 1 minute ago was also history. We cannot change the past, but only improve upon the present.

State of Israel has the right to exist within its set borders.

State of Palestine has the right to exist—> Gaza seems like a recipe for endless conflicts because of stark differences with the state of Israel and geography. Maybe, the Arab states including Israel should get together to workout a better plan. I don’t think this’ll be possible whilst the mullahs are in power.

Harbouring hate would only lead to more hate and violence. Any violence leads to more violence as evident from this current cycle started by the massacre of 7th Oct 2023. The war on the idea of Israel needs to stop by accepting its existence as reality for peace and prosperity of all people, especially in this region.

No, I don’t think children should be harmed or made causality of such a complicated issue, even if they are brain washed by Hamas terrorists. Children are in a building up state and even if inconvenient or dangerous, we need to keep humanity alive by taking the risk of reforming children without bias rather than taking the easy route of making them a causality.

Iran need a regime change, and a democratic constitutional monarchy—>

Mullahs of Iran are so out of touch with reality of the world. First thing they need to do is restore rights of women. At least, be at par with rest of the Middle East, taking UAE as an example. I understand the intricacies of diverse society’s and beliefs, such changes can’t happen in a moment, but if we talk about learning from history than Iran was not this conservative during the Pahlavi rule and was getting modernised. Iran’s rich culture and history has been the biggest causality of this oppressive + clueless regime burdened by ways of the fear, rather than freedom + liberty.

Presence of Israel enriches the Middle East and compliments rest of the region whether it’s Lebanon or Saudi Arabia or Egypt or Jordan if you look from the long term perspective of growth.

Peace only has one cost, to give up hate and it’s worth it.

### **China / Taiwan**

What does China wants? I bet no one can answer that question. Not even the CCP. It can’t be more land? Taiwan is a small island. Semiconductor supply chain? Nah. They have been developing own chips and sooner or later will catch up on that front.

Taiwan seems to be doing really well for a small country, though under constant fear of a siege by China.

Is it domination and the power to set the rules? If you are not setting the rules then someone is setting them for you? It’s something in build into human beings regardless of region or ethnicity or race that we want to be better than the rest, until we grow up to realise blandness of this desire. The whole point of rules is they shouldn’t be set in anyone’s favour, but for progressing cycles.

There’s a small minority in China that the CCP supports and wants to make whole by bringing Taiwan into the fold? It again sounds like fighting for history, rather than the present, for an unburdened future.

Again, international politics is played on a different pane of reality where egos play as much role as desires with little logic. To balance local micro issues with multiple macro perspectives is not easy, though solving them with aggression is also not ideal. If the Russia/Ukraine war is senseless, I don’t even know what we should call a hypothetical war between China/ Taiwan. It won’t even be a war, but a hostile Chinese takeover unless USA+ allies decide to intervene, and that means taking the world back about 50, if not 100 years in the past. That’ll be a real world war with all other conflicts boiling into two major fractions.

It’ll be worse than it sounds and being a reasonable, peace, progress and future loving person, I oppose this potential war as much as any other.

### **India/ Pakistan**

Let’s be honest, Pakistan is a failed state and unable to formidably govern itself with law or order whilst ridden with economic turmoil. India has never started a war with the neighbours, though it has won all of them.

Sometimes, I think about various reasons for the partition other than politics of religion, and one of them seems to be the threat of Khalistan movement. It’s again a senseless issue promoted for the sake of having an issue for geo political power equations and capital reasons.

Whole of Kashmir is an integral part of India.

Unlike Pakistan, Indian culture is strong to support growth and progress despite wide spread systematic corruption. India needs to keep playing on its strength of maintaining the core values, promoting openness and adapting to change, not listening to forces of division or backwardness whilst improving the technicalities from the current position to keep its place as a major player with multilateral approach in the world order, culture and economy.

### **India/ China**

These two countries are the big trade partners. Though, India has to be careful about demotivating China’s attempts to influence its politics or markets. Conflicts are part of the game, but don’t think there’ll be an all out war between the two countries. Unless, India is pulled into larger conflict where it has to support the allies against China. Let’s hope that situation never arrives.

### **USA/ Russia**

We all know the history. It a mix of good and bad. Much of it can be solved with restoration of fair democratic practices in the Russian Federation and a less combative approach from the west. Of course, I am talking about a post Ukraine war future.

### **Immigration**

It’s a necessity for many people in the world due to calamities, oppression or differences with dictatorial regimes. We should also be empathetic to people struggling to accept or worried about their way of life because of cultural differences.

Emerging Tech can have a major impact in improving lives around the world, which could in fact change the nature of immigration from being frowned upon or something being cherished. Long way to go to get for that kind of future.

### South Korea / North Korea

If I have to support anyone in this conflict then it would be South Korea. North Korea needs to emerge from years of oppression into some form of democratic rule.

### India / Canada

Canada’s stance to support Khalistani separatist is an epic fail. Canadian govt. should educate anyone with separatist agenda about international law and integrity of borders, rather than letting those sentiments seep into their own internal politics and become a lobbying point. In fact, the whole khalistani cause makes no sense, why don’t these entities invest in the growth of Punjab, India? This will help the youth in that state as well. Punjab already has massive Sikh majority and is an integral part of India. BOLE SO NIHAL, SAT SRI AKAL 🙏🏽.

### **Censorship of online or other content**

Children everywhere should be protected from all harmful content and predators.

At the same time, Children should be iteratively educated about difficult subjects as they age. Only Protectionism on its own can make them dumb or idiotic as grownups if they don’t learn reasoning or rationalising capabilities with unbiased humanistic values.

Democratic values mean that censorship laws should not be misused by the party in power to suppress free speech in any way or shape or form. Misuse of censorship law for political gains or to protect government in power from criticism should be treated as a crime against democratic values in itself. Prosecuting people for making jokes is the start of suppression, it’s a thin line and needs to be tread with care. Who decides what joke or criticism is right or wrong? In any democracy, discussions can start in a village, a town hall, a cafe, academic institutions, media debates or online before it reaches the parliament to be discussed by elected representatives and we should not close this democratic process because of some insecure politician. Non violence and peacefulness being the base conditions.

That’s all. There are no other “signals” or “signs” or “numbers” as communication. lol.

1. My startup has nothing to do with these Geo political issues.
2. I have absolutely no association with any political party in India or rest of the world. I don’t support any political party and my vote is private + secret as per the constitution of India. My right to vote whether exercised or not in the past or future is a personal choice based on practical reasons. My political views are protected by the universal human rights as endorsed by the UN. In case, any of my family or friends or business partners are associated with a political party then their affiliation or association does not extend to myself in any way, shape or form.
3. Politically I consider myself positioned at the centre rather than left or right. I have no political interests other than free markets for business, democratic law and order, universal human rights, non violence and mindfulness.
