How can you film anything without any light? It’s the most important thing around and free, for the most part. That’s why Black Holes are so intriguing. Wormholes are even more interesting. The Big Bang? Atoms? Schrödinger’s Cat? Quantum entanglement? It’s all about love.

![IMG_0813.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Bollywood%20Edition%20Part%203%E2%80%94%20Perso%2067401a9209224b05a1c1b3888f63ce4d/IMG_0813.jpeg)

Based on the previous few years, or the whole decade, it was apparent that my work has demand. It was about working with the doers. The needle movers.

I was not going to rely on Sanjay to approach OTT platforms. Why burn the bridge, you never know! Also, felt like I had no time to find “better partners.” Ashwin was at least honest about not having access to funding or connections. We were in sync about the script. He was keeping his contacts to himself, but I had already levelled that situation by not including him in the communication with Netflix. His aggressive way of defending any unfavourable topic was also neutralised with humour, sometimes the other person might feel its unhinged banter, but it’s ‘on purpose.’ How else can you talk to a narcissist?! We decided to put all my projects other than TGIRT on his “slate.” I wanted to use that to approach local platforms.

Target was making ‘HEX’ while constantly improving the current position to find better leverage.  

I had noticed some extra activity on Hex’s Bcklst page since sending the script to Alexi. Thought, we can get to an overall ‘8’, rather than ‘8’ only for settings. That should have also improve our leverage. Didn’t change too much, only slight things in the structure, other than couple of additions based on the previous feedback. Strangely enough, the scores dropped! But also, with strangest comments! Didn’t care much.

Based on my advice to improve the edit, Vani asked me to edit her documentary ‘Sisya.’ I did edit it, and thought it was much better, more cohesive story with the new timeline. These things are subjective, anyway. Her comments were positive.

This was going on in parallel with the other timeline. I was still travelling to Jaipur for the tender.

The Nowhere hotel—>

The cafe was good for typing, when you have figured everything out, and it needs labour of pushing the keys. It was not the place to structurally thinkout fictional content. Of course, you will get ideas all the time, but my body needed movement. It just felt natural when I get stuck on a problem, to move. Mumbai is great in that regards, there are plenty of places to surf the waves.

Freshness of ideas is also about freshness of your mind. Nothing was off the charts, from Colaba to Malad to Powai! It’s all my area. Pretty much. One of the cafe’s I used to frequent was Suzette’s in Powai, photo taken there.

![IMG_0014.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Bollywood%20Edition%20Part%203%E2%80%94%20Perso%2067401a9209224b05a1c1b3888f63ce4d/IMG_0014.jpeg)

The hotel was still a steady ship in the storm. As the old Eagles song “You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.”

Hotel Canteen contract was already changed a while back, now it was named “The Hunger Point.” lol. What an awful name for a wannabe cafe?! Overall quality had dropped including the breakfast. I had stopped having breakfast, it was too much for the effort now. The holder of the new lease was also absurd, he was running his own “hotel management classes” in the cafe. Maybe, learn better copy writing skills or concentrate on the food. Whatever. No one liked it. Jessica had left few months ago, they needed some feminine energy. Priyanka was a welcome change. They had no sales at this cafe, because no one wanted to eat the rotten food they used to sell. Every week they would come up with a new absurd scheme to make hotel guests buy something. 

Hotel front staff had also changed. Only Vivek was there from the old timers. They were all fine. The only problem being “the rules.” They were still conflicted about being a hotel or a hostel. I wanted a table and, a comfortable chair in my private pod but they would always make some excuse. I was later told that the “general manager” used to be a laundry supervisor at another hotel, and has no actual experience in hospitality.

Gaurav and Khushbu were still doing their thing. But they were not together since last year, and he would keep blaming me for the split, for some reason?! She said they were just hanging around together, and not dating. Some information emerged about their separate private lives, because of which I kept my distance.

Around 26th Jan, an old man visited the hotel from USA. Let’s call him John Doe. His body was filled with tattoos of every destination he had visited till now with his wife. This was his first time travelling without her since she passed away 🤍. Looked really puzzled, lost and lonely when I spoke to him. Introduced him to other people. He wanted me to be his guide around the city, but I didn’t h have the time for such things. I preferred people discovering things on their own, rather then taking them here or there. How uncool is that?! I thought.

John, Gaurav and me had already been to Tunga Restaurant once for coffee, though ended up ordering a not so good sweet water drink, it was not too much fun.

John kept insisting, therefore, I reluctantly agreed. But then Khushbu, Gaurav and Denil also wanted to tag along. Therefore, I had to back out at the last minute. It was a real scene, totally unecessary as well. Khushbu also cancelled. Gaurav was all he had, but John had figured out by now that Gaurav was a bit of a crackhead, and if he hadn’t then he was about to. 

Detour—>

Denil had been staying there for a while. He had become Khushbu’s for a while, but she would asking me to come with them. I couldn’t because of work. Other than once, when all 4 of us went out to find some drink around mid night to Bandra. We walked its length and breath, but did not have a drink for one or other reasons. Well, I didn’t want to waste money unless it was going to be a unique experience, and none of these people could make their own decisions.

One day she fell really sick, apparently. There was expectations, i did show some concern. But it was mostly Denil who was taking care of her 😆. It was weird. They even went to Osho together, along with her driver 😂. She would come back, and tell me all the stories of making him sleep with the driver. Seemed chill.

Regular Programming—> 

The 4 of them eventually went on the crusade themselves. I had work.

Gaurav came back alone in the evening. lol. I was worried to say the least. He said John was not happy about them making him order a couple of pitchers from Social Bandra, and drinking it themselves. But also, did not show him around! He even called Gaurav and Khushbu by some names. I thought it was funny.

John came back later in the night, not looking happy. He started shouting at me, saying it’s all my fault! Said I was mean, and an asshole. Okay. Not the first time, I had heard these remarks. lol. People blaming me for their own emotional immaturity. What's my fault in this?! So, i couldn’t be his tour guide! Funny. Frank was back by this time, he spoke to John. He was in a better place before leaving.

Back flash—>

Last year, Khushbu was sitting in the cafe, eating some food from outside. I arrived and we were chatting. There were couple of girls sitting on the table perpendicular to her’s. One thing led to another, we started speaking to them. They seemed interesting. One of them said her name is Surpiya Sharma, and she’s from Lahore. I thought she was joking. Strange sense of humour. Of course, i looked her up. She was from Hyderabad.

I had recieved an invite from Australian Consulate in Mumbai for a Bhangra Night, was looking for someone to come along. Asked Supriya. She made an excuse. Later, I sent it to Frank. We were taking, kidding around the hotel front desk. Mehul was on duty. Along with Supriya’s friend, Khushbu was also there. They mocked me for looking her up! Well, I had to if we were gonna continue talking. I might have ended up singing a couple of songs for everyone’s entertainment. Mehul even recorded my performance on video.

There was a female social worker staying there as well. Next day, we were chatting in the cafe, and upon me asking what she does? Her reply was “Straighten up men like you.” I was taken aback. Is it because I am dressed well? Had a meeting. What does that mean? Other than humour, I am the most straightedge person in whole of Mumbai, who’s not even claiming to be saint. She seemed a little embarrassed, and tried to take it back. Anyway, I had a flight to catch next day. Didn’t speak to any of them again.

There was an interior designer staying at the hotel for a while. Khushbu tried setting me up with her, it seemed. But I was not interested. I kept asking her to introduce me to her model friends! She used to work in the makeup industry after all, but never did that 🤷🏾‍♂️. This was a joke, lot of jokes would fly over the top of her head. lol. Didn’t want to meet all the hot models at the same time, one at a time 😅

Back to the future—>

Had another introductory meeting with Tessa of Cinestaan. She knew that I was working with Sanjay, which probably already spoiled the matters. I had shared all materials with her. But they passed on everything. No proper reasoning. Fine. Took this photo at their office in that meeting.

![IMG_0082.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Bollywood%20Edition%20Part%203%E2%80%94%20Perso%2067401a9209224b05a1c1b3888f63ce4d/IMG_0082.jpeg)

I had already edited Vani’s documentary ‘Sisya’, she was back in Mumbai, we were supposed to meet at her home in Madh Island. First time, I travelled there via a ferry from Versova. Vani also knew Sanjay and Onir are producing TGIRT, felt there was some wrong bias based on that. But anyway, we met a communal place in her building complex rather than the house. She had to go somewhere with her mom, i tagged along in an uber. Barely Half way along, the driver said he’s going to stop at a gas station, and there was a massive que of cabs trying to refill gas. Had to argue with him to stop fooling around, and do his job. Vani was surprised for some reason, and said “Now, I know you live in Mumbai.” She also said all this argument does not suit her zen mode. Alright. I delivered the edited documentary. There was some sound takes missing, which she had to supply. It was not brought up again.

The Freezing point—>

If there was one prominent problem with the hotel, it was their industrial air conditioners without individual controls for the private pods or normal pods. This was a corporate tower, not build for a hotel. It used to be freezing and, made no sense. It was also all connected, therefore, if someone’s sick than their bacteria flowing throughout the premises. I used to also make them turn off the Air Conditioning directly facing the seating against the wall and windows. Couple of AC’s at the entrance and front desk were enough to keep the place cool. They AC units were always running.

Khushbu had moved out by now into a rented apartment in Lokhandwala. I had couple of brunches with her. She even showed me her under construction apartments in Bandra Kurla Complex. It was only friendly. 

On St. Patrick’s Day 17th March, Sunday. We were hanging out when Frank asked us to join him at the Irish Bar, Fun Republic. It was near by. Frank was with his girl friend—> Mansi, a Maharashtrian doctor along with Adrian, he was living at the hotel for a few months while interning at ESPN. He was cool. We all were well acquainted to not feel awkward, other than Khushbu. She left only after like 15 mins. Rest of us had few drinks, and general fun. I overheard Frank say to this Adrian “lets Rohit pay our bill.” Alex wanted to pay his own bill. Frank asked me to pay his bill because he was short on cash. I did, on the condition that he will pay me back in a few days.

It’s hard for me to understand people sometimes, I mean how come you don’t have money man?! You are a doctor for fuck sakes! Anyway, I am not here to judge people. Had to insist on payment, but I also had a flight to catch. It was not so much about the money, but ethics and ego. He could have said, “pay for my drinks”, and I would have, but I wasn’t gonna be fooled. Took my flight, asked him to pay cash at the hotel reception. He did in a few days, and also sent me a photo. The hotel paid me back when I got there next time.

Few months later when he got paid for one of his acting gigs, Frank took me for drinks at the nearby Tunga Restaurant. I had about 3 or 5 beers 🍺. It was all fine. 

New Leads, Old Connections—>

We also wanted to push Netflix International for a deal. They had not come back with their thoughts on the script. I had an old contact who was taking development projects for Prime Focus who had bought Double Negative—> Shail Shah. I had Ashwin write to him so as to not look like I was doing everything. He connected us to his people at Double Negative, and their new branch based in India known as Redefine. They seemed to really like the project and understood the scope. This was their review of the script—>

![IMG_0461.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Bollywood%20Edition%20Part%203%E2%80%94%20Perso%2067401a9209224b05a1c1b3888f63ce4d/IMG_0461.jpeg)

These were his subjective opinions, both good and bad. The script also had reviews where the character arcs were praised or other things were not. The point is, it showed interest, and a proper way to do things. I started working to address those comments.

 

We had a VC planned with their head of development etc, but the first meeting was cancelled at the last minute. In the next meeting, Ashwin was less than convincing, coming off unprepared. I had to step in on multiple occasions. It was obvious we didn’t have money, and made clear from the onset. They knew that but now realised that the producer didn’t have much idea about the approach to funding either and, I had to say “it’s at a really early stage” to salvage some hope for connecting later. 

We tried to indulge Shail to help us with funding, but apparently he didn’t have confidence. Maybe, he got fake and negative feedback from someone?! They did take some inspiration for one of their own animation project involving robots. Your welcome.

We were still after development funding from anywhere, it would have helped push Netflix, but also put us in a strong overall position. Just to let you know, Animation productions are a bit different from the onset compared with live action production. I was more interested in taking a hybrid Tech + Film approach, while Ashwin was confused. He was looking for funding for his company which used to provide VFX management, like a talent agency, not even service provider. Niche, but he was not going to get funding for that, so I was not relying on him. 

When nothing happens, you have to make it rain. I had to pull a couple of tricks from my bag to find a connection at ‘Zee Entertainment.’ Well, I knew people there, but didn’t want to approach them. You can read this for an introduction as to why I was cautious approaching this company [THE RAIN MAKERS—> Story + Personal](THE%20RAIN%20MAKERS%E2%80%94%20Story%20+%20Personal%20548a2785251144b3bf7cdb792eb7d0bf.md). I actually did not want to approach them, but they were in the market and seemed like a viable option to make ‘You are a Xingji.”

I had the email of Tarun Katial, CEO Zee5 from Film Bazaar. Had Ashwin write to him. I was apprehensive of the whole thing, because at some point it was going to be brought up to SCG, and his son Punit which meant automatically involving my uncle 😫. If they had not already. I used to keep tabs on Zee, knew they were in trouble. Pretty much following the blow by blow of the downfall. One day, Gaurav comes up to me at the hotel cafe, and asks “how come this person from Haryana knows so much about manipulating stocks?” Hmmm. At another point, a person from Gandhi Nagar, Ahmedabad was staying there, and mentioned doing some dealings Essel Group. He was an older gentleman, previously in NDRF, now working as an ‘Angadiya’ as known in traditional Indian banking or an ‘Escrow’ in modern banking. Interesting, I thought. 

We contacted Zee5 in June, it had been about three months of them expressing interest in the project, but not moving ahead or communicating properly. I was being patient. lol. Because, of all the talk of me being impatient from our previous dealing. But then I thought, whats the point of this much patience?! It seemed like they would lose control of Zee at any time. I consulted Ashwin, and wrote an email to SCG.

We heard back from their team within a week! Alright. They seemed more eager as well. I thought, maybe, just maybe this could work. Boy, was i wrong! Again, the same delays.

![IMG_0464.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Bollywood%20Edition%20Part%203%E2%80%94%20Perso%2067401a9209224b05a1c1b3888f63ce4d/IMG_0464.jpeg)

The Youths raid the hotel—>

More young people had been coming to stay at the hotel. That’s always cool. Gaurav was constantly eating up my all this time. He was fine for a conversation, even used to make intelligent points, till he would pivot to one of his self indulgent tangents. You could tell, he was always trying to hide something about himself. At the same time, he also came across kind on some occasions.

A young person started appearing in the cafe during this time—> Chikeershu Rawat. Like a perpetual gym wannabe. lol. He had this “better than all of you losers vibe.” of course, i could relate because of having a similar vibe myself, at one point. I spoke to him, then introduced to everyone including Frank. He became good friends with Adrian. Nice. Don’t be lonely. For some reason, Gaurav was jealous of him taking attention of “the group” 😂

Shruti, a follower of ‘Shri Shri’ was staying at the hotel, she used to hang out in the cafe quite a bit. I was not really interested in her either. Not wanting any commitment or trouble. Never shit where you eat sought of thing. Only hot models could understand my plight. lol. But we got talking once, she’s a yoga entrepreneur. There was an argument about something, I probably made a sarcastic comment about her business, Gaurav made a smooth move at the same time, and they were together for a while. Till they were not. He told me about meeting her in Gurugram for dinner, but she won’t let him sit on the chair in front of her, but on the chair next to it, like on the next table 😭😂. Okay?! That’s weird.

New Leads, Old Connections—>

We were put in touch with the creative at ‘Zee5.’ Two fella’s named Rohit Hipalgaonkar and Milind Gadagkar. 

They didn’t bother to contact us after the introduction, so we reintroduced ourselves. Requested for a meeting, but would get the strangest of replies from them. Like they were in kindergarten, and didn’t understand basic English. The whole purpose of Rohit Hipalgaonkar was to arrange meeting, but totally inefficient at it, like you have one job bro?! Still, i was being patient.

Finally, we decided to speak on the phone. Milind tells me his father is not well, he has to be at a hospital…something, something. That’s why he couldn’t connect properly. He didn’t want to lose his job! I was understanding. We decided to help him, and wait for him to be free of personal issues.

![IMG_0462.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Bollywood%20Edition%20Part%203%E2%80%94%20Perso%2067401a9209224b05a1c1b3888f63ce4d/IMG_0462.jpeg)

![IMG_0463.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Bollywood%20Edition%20Part%203%E2%80%94%20Perso%2067401a9209224b05a1c1b3888f63ce4d/IMG_0463.jpeg)

We had shared everything with them already. Everything. It turns out Milind was not at all grateful of our patience or efficient at his job. He got Hipalgaonkar to arrange another call, and in the call asks us “What is this about? What do you want to pitch?” Excuse me?! This guy used to work at Vodafone as a manager of something, not judging, people could be multi talented. But are you on some fucking drug? We were appalled by the unprofessionalism. 

Sure, Ashwin and, myself didn’t have money, but from the onset at Rhythm and Hues, we had been trained to be the best. Not second best. Not lousy third, but the best. We could disagree, and can have bad ideas as well. But we had been dealing with everyone and everything professionally. 

These people were so bad. Milind asked us to send the material again. Alright, fine. Maybe he had too much to deal with. Let’s keep going, we thought.

After a lot of pushing around, we were now invited for a narration. lol. You already read it all asshole. Narration of what? Fine. It’s what they are used to in Bollywood. It’s fine when Actors ask for a narration, as a director you anyway want to talk to them. But you are “creative director?!” You shouldn’t need a narration, you just don’t have your own creative process or any idea of what you are doing. Anyway. I went into give the narration. They were based in a ‘We Work’ about 5 to 10 mins from the Hotel. It was like an amusement park. Women playing with their dogs right outside the gates, cafe and whatnot. Just lacking some spirit of getting the work done.

Milind tells me, that no one comes alone, usually its a junket of 5 to 10 people. lol. What I should invent people for show?! We don’t have the money to hire anyone, but also, It’s not required at this stage. “Thats what they are used to!” Alright, make a list of every senseless thing you have to do for mere obligation. Narration went fine, he even agreed on most of the stuff. It looked like we also had broad understanding of the approach, despite of everything. He again asked us to send something. We did. It’s one thing not agreeing creatively and, altogether another to be bad in your communication.

From June, when we first contacted them, now it was November end. We had still not made any progress. This was unacceptable. I wrote to their CEO Tarun Katial again. 

![IMG_0465.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Bollywood%20Edition%20Part%203%E2%80%94%20Perso%2067401a9209224b05a1c1b3888f63ce4d/IMG_0465.jpeg)

Right after sending this email, Hipalgaonkar asked me to send him beet sheets for the first two episodes, before another meeting. I sent it as agreed. Delivered.

I thought about taking Frank, Chikee and Shakey with me to “look like a team.” Obviously, decided against that crazy thought. lol. 

Same atmosphere at their office. Anyway, as I was getting inside, saw Milind walking out. Even said ‘Hi’, but he didn’t reply. Kept walking. What else could you expect from an absolute unprofessional moron?

There was a new person named Raghav, VP of idioticness in the meeting with Hipalgaonkar. They had a man dressed up smartly come in to offer drinks, I thought he was someone from the staff, tried to shake his hand. Is that a crime?! How does that reflect smallness? He was not carrying water in the first instance, but taking the order. Only for the small minded people. Anyway, this new guy had a suggestion that we should try to make this into a feature film, rather than a series. Alright! Are you going to fund the development?! “No.”

I had enough by now, and wrote the following—>

![IMG_0466.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Bollywood%20Edition%20Part%203%E2%80%94%20Perso%2067401a9209224b05a1c1b3888f63ce4d/IMG_0466.jpeg)

This could have materialised if these idiots had kept a broader mindset of seeing the actual scope of expanding the reach of their platform altogether using YAMX, rather than thinking of fitting this into their scheduled programming. Not only do you need an open mind to calculate the long term Marco, but also less of an ego. I was hoping to have that conversation at some point, though it seemed they were way below my level.

Milind clearly did not respect this Raghav to attend the meeting. They had no intention of making it work because of their personal issues rather than for the interest of the company. I would still have my content with various parties interested in it. Who are you without this job? VP of what?! His attitude was that of a marketing intern without any tact or sense. Ups and downs aside, I had been working in this industry since 2007, not shilling third class content for a job. If you don’t have respect for those actually doing the work when that’s your whole job then what the fuck are you even doing?! I could have had this idiots job any day, but I was better at telling cinematic stories. 

Your ad revenue is as good as your content. If you keep making bad content, that only appeals to people watching soft porn then thats the kind of revenue you are going to generate. Your job is not only to make the content that the audience wants to watch, but also to keep upgrading so that the audience is upgraded, and therefore, your revenue is not totally dependent on whims and fancies of the market trends. There are no real technical insight that makes Zee5 better than MX players or any other OTT platform. Both are lagging behind from the top performers, which is highest bidder of the IPL. If you are not even trying to make the kind of content that has aesthetic quality along with having broad appeal then you are nothing but a third class streaming service that nobody watches. Audience are more interested in watching Instagram stories, anyway.

On top of that, disastrous financial decisions by the promotors shows a total lack of clear thinking or common sense. The whole enterprise is being dragged upon by the idioticness of the people who only know to strong arm and manipulate, rather than build anything of real value to sustain earnestly. If your decision is that “we don’t want to create anything awesome because manipulating stocks makes more money” than there you are in your bubble. Zee5 is given away for free with every packaged deal in town to sell data, so don’t throw fake viewer numbers at me. STFU. 

It does not end there. In 2020 someone brought a series bible titled ‘Sunshine Society’ to my notice in production at Zee5. It was basically made by copying YAMX settings, and some characters. So, it could have been a series after all?! We had no doubt that it would had been an awesome series. Not to forget MX Player making an offer for it last year, and Culture Machine trying to steal it prior to that. You know when an idea has 🤌🏾. Bunch of jerks. 

The Law, the DJ and Home Ministry at the hotel—>

Just when you think you have met all kinds of people the world has to offer, there’s always a surprise waiting for you around the corner.

Sometime during the year, a figure started appearing in the hotel corridors. A little hunched over, always dressed in casual suit, carrying a bag, smelling like dettol, arguing with someone or other, in his 60’s this is Mr. Ramani! No one came to stay at this hotel permanently, but then get used to the comfort of being in the nowhere land. 

First time, I noticed Mr. Ramani was at the front desk, threatening to take legal action against the hotel, because they has asked him to change the sanitzer due to its smell. Initially, I thought he was totally nuts, but then one things led to another like always, and I got talking to him which confirmed that I was right. lol. He’s intelligent, really knowledgable about the law, but not particularly connected to any ground truth. 

You can say I humanised him to the rest of the crowd at the hotel. It started with introducing him to Gaurav, apparently they got really close during my absence as well. 

Maybe, Mr. Ramani was universe’s way of teaching me to survive the pandemic. lol. Because, he used to live like its a pandemic, without it being a pandemic. Maybe, it was a warning about the importance of mental health, personal health, and relationships. He would not eat any regular food, but mostly canned food or taken out from the vending machines. Even that food he would open in plastic boxes which he used to carry around as well. All this out of the fear of being poisoned by someone hired by his brother, and father due to a property dispute. None of us ever understood the exact case, but it sounded scary. There will be more about him later.

Another notable person staying at the hotel around the same time was Satyam. He was employed by the home ministry, ITBP. I have utmost respect for all the branched of the armed forces. I Started talking to him because he was being misguided by some people staying there, and around the town. Talking to him also helped me realise that even forces are made of individuals with personal aspirations, and dreams. But he was also not connected to the ground truth of his passion. He went about dealing with everyone like we owed him something for passing the civil services exam, which was strange because here you are trying to make film. The first step in making a good film is to stop thinking that are not special. You might be, but it’s no point putting yourself on that pedestal. I had to learn that myself, and thats partly where the humour comes from. 

He was extremely judgemental, and even thought Gaurav had some kind of authority over me, and that’s why I agreed with him sometimes. lol. Just agreeing with whoever is being logical. I had no incentive to suck up to anyone including Satyam. Think, i gave him honest feedback about his situation without getting myself in a position of getting punched in the face for no reason. 

Once, we met at the Irish House, Fun Republic. As soon as I entered, saw Punit Goenka standing there, talking to someone. Anyway. I did learn about Uttar Pradesh’s film tax incentives from Satyam. Keeping an open mind if important, you can learn from anyone, and briefly thought about structuring a project around that. It never materialise.

Another person who looked lonely, and waiting for someone to give him attention was Abhishek Verma aka DJ Shakey. He had tattoos, though not as many as John Doe. Shoulder length hair. Remember introducing him to Frank to begin with, being fellow travellers. He seemed troubled by something, not knowing what he was doing there, lost, and desperately trying to prove that he’s more than the display. Problems of the youth. He had studied in London, we had a common thing to connect, said he was deported because of working full time on an invalid visa. As evident, I had been in all kinds of situations in London, myself. No judgment. But I never did anything to get “caught”, they can make you do all kinds of things in those situations. Scary.

He loved to speak non stop or maybe just because I am good at listening. Though, not while I am working on something important. He won’t take the signs of me changing seats, or not sitting in the same space. In fact, would feel bad if i would ask him to shut up. I get it kid, you want to shed the load and, i started it by asking all the questions in the first place, opening you up. But I need to get paid and, do this work!

We went to dinner few times, felt he was always showing off or being too self conscious, and i was too bothered by that behaviour in addition to Gaurav for some reason. lol. One time, Gaurav also tagged along. We went to The Hard Rock Cafe in Andheri, it was completely deserted till a whole party showed up to celebrate someone’s birthday. There was a small stage where they kept singing and performing on this song called YMCA. Funny. No, it was really funny.

Ashwin was trying to connect some of the old Rhythm and hues colleague’s who were also interested in making movies. He spoke to them. Made a WhatsApp group. I was invited. As soon as I sent a message in that group saying “Hi”, the other dude named Prabhav, left the group! What?! lol. Ashwin said he’s not social. Well, he’s apparently also a complete douche bag.

Chikeershu wanted to be an actor, was interested in working in movies, and interning with someone making a meganamopus. He would keep singing praises of this person and his riches. Alright bud, just don’t get caught up in something. Then he showed us a trailer of a series they were trying to make, it was shot alright in basic quality, edited badly, overall it looked like made by someone just out of a film school. But, the biggest problem might be that it had title cards saying “Produced by Steven Spielberg”, Music by “A R Rahman” and about anybody’s name you could imagine. We all had to contain ourselves, it was apparent they won’t lend their names to something like this. Couldn’t tell him in that moment. Only Frank thought the trailer was good, maybe it was the weed, but he also thought Narendra Modi’s biopic was good, he even had a prominent acting role in that film. I just think our prime minister deserves a better biopic, maybe soon after the end of his term.

There was a Pharmaceutical Sales team staying at the hotel with their massive bags filled with all kind of food products as gifts. It was mainly Chirag, and a Sardar Ji from Ahmedabad with other team members showing up sometimes. They had to carry the suite cases to every meeting! They were gentle, and minded their own business for the most part. I was the only one talking to them in general.

The hotel cafe had change of lease again, multiple times during the year, it was much better after “The Hunger Point” left. They implemented a “rule” that stopped Zomato or Swiggy delivery guys to deliver food at the hotel door, and the food would need to be collected from downstairs. Another unnecessary inconvenience for the guests, because these people did not understand the basics of hospitality. Yes, overall the hotel was worth the money, they used to keep it clean, but the crowding was taking its toll. The number of guests increased because of low rates, when they increased the rates, the numbers fell dramatically. But there was no attempt to make it easy or pleasant for those staying regularly for 2 years! 

In fact, they would indulge in crazy practices like deep cleaning the cafeteria in the middle of the day! All hotels deep clean public places after hours only, so that the guests are not inconvenienced. But not this hotel! It’s fine if you don’t have hot or cold water in the shower one day, put a label, close that bathroom, but to make me feel bad about bringing it to your notice is ridiculous. As a budget hotel, If you don’t feel like the price is worth providing great customer service, then at least don’t enforce random or unnecessary rules out of pettiness. 

Mr. Ramani was opening up slowly, he used to talk to us and, was better for that. Loneliness is bad for everyone. Satyam, Mr. Ramani, Chikeershu and myself decided to go watch The Joker. Catching the cab had become increasingly difficult from this place because of all the construction work for the underground metro, and being generally crowded because of the commercial location. It used to take an extra half hour at least, if not an hour to find a cab, and then an effort to board it. There was some mix up with the cab, it arrived but the app notification did not show it, we ended up convincing the same driver to take us to the cinema. Satyam on one side, and Mr. Ramani on another, I just could not take it, and decided to return with Chikee because the show had already started. Leaving Satyam and Mr. Ramani alone. lol. They came back in one piece.

Gaurav and myself were regularly going for diner at the nearby Tunga Restaurant, along with anyone else who would tag along. I thought one of the waitress there from Manipur was cool, we spoke once, but nothing more. One day, Gaurav tells me that he likes Priyanka of the cafe, but is scared to ask her out. Well, for his sake I told him to give it a shot, buy her jewellery like earrings, women love that stuff, and it shows that you actually care. He was weird about it.  

Detour—>

I had been visiting Chawri Bazaar, and Ghanta Ghad with parents since childhood, but got re introduced to Chandni Chowk by Anugrah Bahl, from Himachal Pradesh, met him on the set of Rikhil’s film shoot. We were trying to make the no budget TGIRT when there was not anything on paper 🤦🏾‍♂️ , and he told me about Chandni Chowk being a great market for buying film/ camera equipment. After that, I visited many times to buy small camera stuff, and film demos with my 360 degree camera being a happening place with so much culture as it looked good in VR. Loved those small gullies, the old building, heavily wired electric poles, and a lot of history. But also the street food as you get the whole variety there which is also fresh because of keeping busy.

Regular Programming—>

Because i used to get sick quite frequently on previous occasions in Mumbai, had to eat cautiously. Even though i like street food, it was a deliberate decision to not eat any for a while so as to preserve the health. Even then, my usual eating spots were not fancy, but a small Sardar ji’s restaurant nearby to the hotel that used to serve thali for Rupees 75, or even a cheaper option for rupees 50. Also, it was about eating less potato, it’s tasty, but not the best for health on a regular basis. Especially, when you are living away from home, and eating out whole day on a tight budget. My other regular option was a fruit vendor who used to put together lovely mix fruit plate for rupees 30 or 50, it was worth it, even though i had to walk about 2 KM everyday.

Frank re introduced me to Gol Gapas/ Pani Puri as he used to eat them regularly from a street vendor close by the hotel. 

I also decided to write a movie based in the hotel, thought it was an awesome location because of all the factors described above. Wanting to make it with relatively no budget, like the original TGIRT. All these meeting, and talks were frustrating! I keep drifting towards doing and building. We followed the ‘Chandrayaan 2’ mission on televisions at the hotel, partly inspired by that—> This untitled film was called “The Moon Project” for the time being.

The view from the 26th Floor—>

Thought, we could do better than Zee5. Hotstar seemed like a good proposition. Didn’t want to ask Sid Jain for introduction even though he worked there, his comments questioning my experience had bothered me, other than having different cinematic synergies. Where was he coming from?! 

I found out the guy running ‘Hotstar’ at that time on LinkedIn. Looked him up at other places like twitter, found he’s really into sports, cricket in particular. We shared an interest. Good. I guessed his email. Not kidding. It’s not that difficult. 

Ashwin was initially reluctant, thought they won’t reply as we were already facing difficulties dealing with Zee. This was ongoing in parallel. Drafted an email, and had him send it. It worked! Nikhil Madhok replied, and connected us to Manisha Tripathi.

Star TV was based in Lower Parel, travelling from and to there was equivelant to one’s day hotel rent. Even more sometimes depending on the app surcharges. Not a huge problem as I liked the commute. There was Phoenix Palladium Mall nearby to their office, where I used to relax, get it togoether before walking upto their office building.

We had an introductory meeting on the 26th floor after I went through a rigorous security check, more thorough than the airports. The meeting itself was as expected, usual stuff. Ashwin also attended the meeting via video call. Manisha did give vibes of being an FBI officer. lol. We sent her everything as discussed in the meeting.

She came back to us within few days expressing interest in ‘The Great Indian Rope Trick/ TGIRT’ Alright, I liked that script more than any other. It was even more 🤌🏾 than YAMX when you get into the details. Next meeting, there were already some little power games being played, I don’t know much time this whole industry spends in doing al this stupidity, rather than their job. Anyway, she asked if we want to make TGIRT as a series rather than a feature film?! Ashwin was also attending via video call, and both of us were a little surprised though ready to go ahead if they wanted to invest in development. She refused to pay for development. It’s a significant effort involved to build a series from a feature film script already at like 80th draft, that too without being paid. It was a beautiful feature film script, not a series. 

One person wants you to make a series into a feature film, another wants you to make a feature film into a series. What’s going on?! Fine, pay for it. Put your money where your mouth’s at. I have already put significant efforts and money developing all this. Who are you to question that based on your corporate job title, and talents in kissing ass to decide what I should do without paying money?!

We told Manisha that we are not interested in developing TGIRT into a series without any development funds. We offered her offer material we had been developed including ‘Masters of the Sky’ 🍸 a completely fictional take about corporate India from 1970’s to 1990’s inspired by “A feast of vultures.“ Ashwin was excited about that, saying it the best of the lot. We all have our tastes.

Manisha didn’t like any of that. We had a really good phone call to talk about everything I was doing, and she invited me for another meeting to discuss something she had been working on. I liked Manisha, because she could make decisions unlike some of the other people I had dealt with till now.

I gather a lot of research before going into any meeting, backgrounds, aware about connections, this and that even if people don’t realise it. It helps in connecting the dots, to put things into perspective in terms of viability. You don’t read “between the lines” just on its own. Among other things, one of the series Hotstar had commissioned was being made by Nagesh Kukunoor had a plot point eerily similar to my script “Civil War.” Coincidences can happen all the time. It also means they are interested in my kind of narratives. Anyway. Of course, I know we are taking a hUge chance, 1/100 all of this works out absolutely smoothly. But if their’s anyone to make it happen, it’s us. You gotta be ready to fall flat on your face, it takes balls to even try.

Regular programming—>

I had couple of more meetings with Sanjay Suri during the year, not expecting anything of him at this point, but you never know. I did ask him if ‘Applause Entertainment’ had replied to his email from last year. Nope. lol. Thought, he could be somewhat useful in making the ‘The Moon Project.’

You never know had a real meaning when I heard from Mr. Mehta of ‘Miraj Group’ for the Nathdwara Project in between all this. They wanted us to submit a presentation for the installation inside the Shivji’s statue which was now near completion. Decided to involve Ashwin in this project as thats pretty much what his company NGCS actually did. We were to visit the site in early January of the new year.

There were guests coming into the hotel all the time, though I was too busy and uninterested in friendships. A writer girl from Indore thought I was into her, sorry, I am dressed well for the meetings! Started shouting at me completely unnecessarily when I corrected her navigation compass for her own safety. If you want to go to Powai, then you gotta know where it’s at! Why are you shouting at me?! Experiences like these had made me even more cautious to say the least. She ended up going out with Gaurav as well. lol 😂. Great.

Shakey was still there, he had found some people to hangout with other than myself. There was a strange couple staying for a while at the hotel along with their “creative team.” I overheard them few times to understand they were just too bla bla. Shakey apparently hooked up with one member of their team. I knew because she came and, sat right next me on the sofa, in the morning. It was not usual or normal. She was still in night clothing. Sat with feet facing me. The whole cafe was empty, she could have sat anywhere. Shakey had booked a private room last night, instead of a private pod or a pod. Private rooms of this hotel had a reputation among couples looking for a good time f**k*ng. Adults minding their own business. The staff would tell me about this one instance when someone left condoms hanging all over the ceiling 😂. I had never booked a private room.

The couple got to know about Shakey and this girl. They were threatening to beat up Shakey! I thought fine, he will run away, and leave my ears alone 😭🤣. But something was sorted, and the couple left after a while.

Another interesting personality at the hotel was Athar Ali Nagpurwalla. We just randomly got talking in group settings. He’s an entrepreneur. Didn’t like Modi ji at all, some conversation about how air conditioning works with a father son duo turned into something else, and we all witnessed his animated political speech. It was to be seen to be believed. Like someone had sucked all the air out of the place, placed it in a vacuum for few minutes, and snapped us back. He will make a reappearance later.

There was also Sachin from Shimla, Himachal Pradesh. He was an apple farmer and, a film maker. Trying to finish and, sell his independent film about electric vehicles. We became friends. He would always have a cap on, besides interest in MMA. introduced him to the whole lot.

Gaurav and Mr. Ramani had a falling out. I was also not on the best of terms with Gaurav because he was really jealous, envious and annoying at times. But then you keep seeing each other at the cafe to forgive, and get along. That used to happen between everyone. 

One day Mr. Ramani came, and said he had found the holy grail of making money. That it was the only thing missing from his bag of trick. It’ll blow our mind as soon as he hear about this idea. Knowing Mr. Ramani, we had to keep our expectations in check, but he build up really well. Even asked us to not tell everyone. Alright! Just tell us! What is it?! “The Internet.” lol 🤣🤣🤣 He said it would change the way people do business. Well, it already had. He was only 20 years late. He even said something about Modi ji that the whole of Delhi knows 🤣. We didn’t. Said he had met someone at the pods who’s going to introduce him to Amit Shah and, he will become the chief advisor to the Indian government. He even claimed to give this person some money, and obviously never heard from him again. Not all of it was fun.

Detour—>

Ashwin and me were still working towards the goal to make Hex. Alexi from Netflix was still reading the script. The independent film, the series, everything would have only gotten us closer to the goal. We also contacted an agent based in Hollywood Jai Khanna. We were trying to approach anyone relevant that we had access to find development funding. We had a video conference, it didn’t seem he was taking it too seriously. We shared the business plan, but never heard back. This happens all the time in Hollywood. He could still have been useful later.

Another pair of girls from Canada were staying there. We had a little chit chat here, and there but a lot of stuff was going on for me to spend attention, and money on random strangers. Martha ended up with Mr. Ramani 😂 and Catrina, a divorced teacher, apparently with Frank 🤣. They seemed cool in general, but thought me hanging around the cafe was because of them. Hello?! I had been sailing this ship for years now. Frank corrected them re this misconception of theirs “He’s working in the industry, that’s why staying here!” Frank and I had an unsaid understanding about being legit around these parts. Mr. Ramani was taking money from Martha! She was also visiting some hocus pokus local guy for treatment of something. I was not judging, but all this had me a little concerned. Cats started showing up on the hotel floor during this time. 

At one point it seemed a fusion version of Canadian and Indian horror story with all the hocus pokus happening at the hotel cafe. Some fellow travellers were scared, i thought it was funny. What happened to people’s belief in science?! Again, too busy to care. I was spending less and, less time at the cafe as there was a lot of thinking, writing in diary, rather than typing.

Cartina said I was really rude before leaving. Why did all tourists had expectations that I could be their tour guide just because I am living at the hotel?! Sure, she was really cute, but I had this meeting at ‘Zee5’ on the same day! And, I was working on it, and multiple other stuff before that. In high sight, maybe I made a bad call 🤣 😭. But like Yuri had said last year “Everything happens for a reason.”

Other than the hotel cafe, and the Tunga Restaurants, a regular spot to hang out was Tata Starbucks at Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport. It was only 5 to 10 mins away on a autorickshaw. Open 24 x 7! Plenty of space to walk around if you are feeling inertia inside the cafe. Plenty of places to eat around. You could go there at odd times, and find food! That made the whole experience even better.

One hell of a flight—>

![IMG_0023.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Bollywood%20Edition%20Part%203%E2%80%94%20Perso%2067401a9209224b05a1c1b3888f63ce4d/IMG_0023.jpeg)

I was thinking about staying at the hotel during Diwali holidays because would have needed to again spend on air tickets to fly back to ground zero. But mom insisted that I be present on Diwali. Fine. Nothing was gonna happen around that time anyway. Booked a flight from Mumbai to Goa to Delhi. I like spending as much time on air as possible 🤷🏽‍♂️. 

Left the hotel in late morning, the flight to Goa was supposed to fly sometime in the afternoon, followed by a layoff for few hours before travelling to Delhi. This was all before the Tata group bought back Air India.

The flight was already a little delayed because of bad weather conditions. But finally it was in the Air. Had a window seat, an older couple was sitting right next to me. Of course, i would have preferred hot models. The food used to be pretty bad back then, still its included, and I was kinda hungry. Ate a little. The flight was facing turbulence all this time as it was raining outside. Nothing out of the ordinary. I had been on all kinds of take offs, and landings by now. But it just couldn’t land the first time because of severe rain, and kept circling above the Goa Airport. Tried a second time, nope. Still circling. Started feeling a bit uneasy, heavy breathing. I had to open all my shirt buttons, the old couple gave me a weird look as the flight tried to land a third time, but couldn’t. 

The Captain said that they have either enough fuel to try one more landing or fly back to Mumbai airport. If they couldn’t land on another attempt, then it could be trouble. So, he decided to fly back to the Mumbai airport, all the way back from Goa. I thought, Diwali couldn’t be better! lol. Had buttoned up my shirt. The old man sitting alongside himself was a little drowsy because the landing attempt was dicey as warned by the captain.

Anyway, we landed back in Mumbai. But were told to stay in the Air Plane as they were going to refuel, and fly us back to Goa! Alright! Everyone else was getting a bit agitated, I just didn’t care other than being a little bored. It had been an hour, there were various narratives floating around. I was in touch with Air India customer care on the phone as well. This all went for another couple of hours. The pilots had de boarded the airplane because their shift had ended or something. They had connected a hangar to the plane, but still could not decide anything. The ground staff, crew and customer care all had separate version of the proceedings—> it was hilarious to see so much confusion. Either you can fly or not?! lol. At the front of the plane, I had to calm down an aggressive passenger, and help bring clarity that we in fact do need to get down as the airplane was not going to take off because of various reasons. That’s what was decided after a lot of deliberation. 

All the passengers had gathered at an arrival hall with no clear communication or instructions. Few people from Air India were present there, but unable to provide any answers. Then a lady official shows up with a plan. Passengers were separated as per their intended destinations, those who had a connecting flight were to follow her. We followed her, but she disappeared mid way! Like smoke and mirrors. lol. Another official from Air India came to guide us through rest of the way, and left us somewhere inside the departure building. The passengers divided before were all at the same spot now. lol. It was early morning. 

One more official had come to talk to us. Told us to get the renewed boarding passes from the counters by showing the old boarding passes. But the counter was not issuing any boarding passes! lol. They kept trying to delay. It was comedy of errors to say the least. Passengers were getting agitated with no one from the official staff was able to provide any clarity. Some people started shouting. Well, can’t blame them. That’s when I noticed couple of older frail looking air India executives watching all this from a distance. They were scared to approach the passengers 🤣. 

Went to speak them, they agreed to knowing everything, but still seemed apprehensive for some reason. Aggressive people had followed me, now they were shouting at these executives. Some of us calmed them down. An arrangement was agreed as per which rather than being flown to Goa, we were going to get direct flights to Delhi. Hurray!!! Well, I still wanted to visit Goa 🤷🏽‍♂️. But whatever, let’s take the tickets, I thought. It was around 10am. Almost 24 hours since I left the hotel for the airport, still at the airport. Surreal. 

A person i met during the above situation turned out to be from the Income Tax Department. Fine. I don’t have much income anyway, so nothing to be afraid about. lol. But good contact for the future, I thought. Bought him a drink at the Irish house, had one myself. While we were boarding the plane, he introduced me to a CBI officer. This trip keeps getting better, I thought. From a failed trip to Goa, I was getting to meet spies! lol. Rest of the journey went as expected.

The Game Room—>

This was my third time on the 26th floor and, probably the best outing I ever had. There was another guy in the communication, and in the meeting named Karn. I went into the meeting with no expectations. She introduced me to a project she had been trying to develop for a while titled Game Room. I knew this was right up my alley, during the presentation itself. Also, that she had no clue other than a basic idea of wanting to develop something around gaming. I said whatever came up in my mind—> “I want absolute freedom, your presentation is fine, but this all would need to be changed. It’s going to be expensive.” Blunt. Weirdly, she was happy with all my demands! lol. It’s like hitting a creative jackpot. Never that simple. I also gave Manisha credit for taking a chance. Still not being paid, but it’s good to be asked to develop stuff. I was given a couple of weeks to come up with a detailed concept presentation.

Involved Ashwin, even though I could have involved anyone else. An NDA was signed which included a basic release form.

I had been playing video games from an early age, even more than that, dealing with problems to run them on a PC that was not made to run a lot of games. That aspect became more interesting, even though we had a gaming console. Remember dad’s friend Bhatia uncle telling me to play video games whenever I was hungry. Ohkay! 

Also remember getting really good on the console that it frustrated one of my friends to leave in a fit. Saying I can’t do that! Why not?! It’s basic stuff. lol. Now we had rented his American cousin’s house. An old couple. This uncle called me during the presentation to Jaipur Government mentioned here [HOW NOT TO START UP? 3D Edition—> Personal + Factual](HOW%20NOT%20TO%20START%20UP%203D%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Factual%20c486fc8f6f7a4a1ba2e67f3e3e689881.md)  for some random errand, out of nowhere. That was odd. Anyway.

There was no way to develop a purely Indian version of ‘The Game Room’ that could be best in the world. By this time, news of Disney merging with Hotstar was out, as they were acquiring 20th Century Fox. Manisha and co had started using Disney emails as well. I decided to develop the best idea, and see what happens. You never know.

![IMG_0467.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Bollywood%20Edition%20Part%203%E2%80%94%20Perso%2067401a9209224b05a1c1b3888f63ce4d/IMG_0467.jpeg)

No one at the pods was privy to any of this till now. At least, not from me. They could be making their own assumption as to whats keeping me so “weird”, and occupied.

It was rigorous research, and some serious levelling up to come up with METAGAME, new title of the proposed, and wholly original series.

![IMG_0789.png](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Bollywood%20Edition%20Part%203%E2%80%94%20Perso%2067401a9209224b05a1c1b3888f63ce4d/IMG_0789.png)

Manisha was eager! She checked with me in a couple of weeks as to know the status. It had occupied my brain waves to the max. Assured her it’s being worked upon, and no need to be worried. Sent it within a few days. Ashwin loved it, but also added it being too high concept for the Indian Market. Gave him the above explanation. 

It’s natural to take it easy for a few days after delivering any such thing. Manisha replied within a week or so, on a call saying she really liked it, and to setup a pitch meeting with Nikhil Madhok. I remember just coming out of Naturals in Powai, when I returned her call because of the background noise, to then get a call back from her.

![IMG_0328.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Bollywood%20Edition%20Part%203%E2%80%94%20Perso%2067401a9209224b05a1c1b3888f63ce4d/IMG_0328.jpeg)

I took this screen shot because of being around the block enough times. She did not replied to the email itself. They could have just stolen the idea. It would be absolutely foolish of them, but you never know. That’s what these people do, they take someone’s world, someone else’s services, and make something shitty while taking the credit for the good, and putting all the blame on others to save their jobs. Nope.

I arrived at the Phoenix Mall about an hour early in anticipation of the meeting. Wanted to feel a little light, and not as blunt as I was in the last meeting. Thought, I would try a little Don Draper technique, and had a tequila shot with 15 mins to spare for the meeting. But as soon as I started walking towards their building, my stomach started having some trouble. It was exactly the time for the meeting when I came out of the toilets. I was in complete control, and conscious. Ran towards the office. Went through the security check. It seemed like they were adding something to it every time. lol. Made it to the 26th floor. They were not waiting for me. Texted her.

Manisha started looking for a conference room for the conversation/ presentation. She called in Nikhil. I took him through the deck. He was particularly interested in amalgamation of Matrix/ Inception / Twin Peaks mentioned as ref to the world. I did feel slighly under prepared to completely nail the references in simple language. But these are complicated topics. Manisha kept pitching in to help, and it seemed to be working fine. Not perfect, but good enough. It had been close to 2.5 hours, i think for what was originally supposed to be only half n hour long meeting—> it was interesting. I could have kept going. Nikhil got up. But he had not committed anything yet. How could he just leave. I needed money! He said “I can’t take a call right now. Can you write beat sheets for the episodes, and we will take it from there.” I can give you the beat sheets right now! Sit down, I said. lol. 😂 My Don Draper really channeled in! 😆 He looked a little scared, and thats when said “He has other meetings to attend!” 

I was a little pissed, because I wanted it to be green lit on the spot. Manisha didn’t appreciate my candour, obviously. Two of us moved into a different conference room, and had a discussions to make it more Indian, and less expensive. But she was all over the place with her ideas. It was not very directional. Also, she never said anything about the money. It was already taking a toll on me to write all this stuff while doing the construction side job! First thing I would do upon waking up was the paper work for construction from within the pod, even before taking a shower. It used to take couple of hours, then n calls throughout the day with Ash. Zone in, and out. Other than giving money to my brother in his conflict, I had also spent some on booking his flights! But also gave about 80 grand for my Mum’s dental procedure. There were not enough savings. Cash was month to month. Ridiculous to do all this without money! All these people are getting paid to listen, to read the same stuff, they are not even doing a great job at that, why am I the only one not getting paid?! But I dind’t want to seem “difficult to work with.” We decided to write the beat sheets in few weeks as per my convenience, and take it from there.

 

I went right back in the button to work on the beat sheets. Make it all more Indian. Realising, these people don’t have a vision or pockets or mandate to make something with internationally appealing. The thing with building anything narrative, but especially long form series is that once you construct a world, the beat sheets, the scripts were all just about putting the hours in, and having the taste. These people did not understand the basics. They were over reliant on experience of it not working out before, this happened, that happened, therefore w have this process. “You are not a proven name.” Who wrote this thing that you loved?! I have written more original stuff than any proven name in this town this year itself. It’s just unecessary bias to find absolute safety in their jobs. Have you tried comparing Metagame with “The Game room?” There lies all your answers.

I spent about a month doing the beat sheets, including actual scripts for the first two episodes without any real direction from the platform re the narrative. You should be able to pay to explore at your own cost. Sent it. We booked another meeting to discuss. Had included the plot point from ‘Civil War’ intentionally. Hey, you are already using something of mine. Calm down, and pay up. Anyway. 

Again, i reached the 26th floor. No tequila shot this time. Waiting for them to come out, arrange a conference room. Looking out the window. Said ‘Hi’ to Nikhil. Just when Manisha and I were about to go into the conference room. Nikhil pulls her apart, they are discussing something in the room on their own. She came out, and it was a different vibe altogether. 

Hostile to say the least. Anything I would say, she would counter it with the most strange reasoning. Like saying without saying “Just quit yourself or we will make you pay.” lol. Well, once I step on the 26th floor, it’s not yours anymore. I was not going to leave with this thing without making a valiant effort to get paid for all the work. Somehow, brought it to where it was decided to work on it a little bit more, and discuss in another meeting in a couple of weeks.

Well, I was just burned out and, tired to say the least. The hotel environment was not that relaxing in itself. It never even occurred to me that one could take a vacation. It was all work, work and work. I worked on Metagame a bit more, took out the reference to ‘Civil War.’ Made it even more Indian, and low budget. Like I said, its all possible when the world is established, but it should have been paid for. Ashwin was shifting to India as his wife was about to deliver, so he was going to accompany me on this next meeting around mid December.

Before Sunset—>

I was going from day to day like a walking talking film scripting machine. Trying to build movies on paper because the camera is too expensive.

There was a massive crane right outside the hotel window used to move large blocks of concrete from one side to another for the underground metro construction. It was so poetic seeing this crane it working within a process, lifting those large bricks one by one, but you couldn’t describe it in words. How would it make sense? It was beauty in action.

I used to visit Juhu beach more often now, taking walks, trying to find some meaning in life by looking at the waves in perpetual motion guided by the room. The construction crane, and the waves seemed to have some connection. Beautiful, I thought. Would stand on the sand as the waves hit my feet, slowly taking away the sand from underneath while lightly ticking the bottom. Close your eyes, open your arms, and you could feel the earth rotating on its axis with every back, and forth motion of the ocean waves. Dark of the night. I am never going to find love, I thought.

There were plenty of lonely people all around me at the hotel. So what?! Maybe, I would be one of those sad people who help other people with humour, and depth. I had plans to leave earth on a space ship. So, it doesn’t even matter. 

Life was more about trying to find wonders in the ordinary things. I started appreciating little things. Discovered this Wine bar in Colaba. It felt like a place where time, and space have no meaning. They even had a beautiful backyard filled with garbage bags. This place had so many doors. But it all opened up to this central place with the wine bar.

It was December, peak tourist season. Guys at the hotel were trying to pick up women tourist. I was just not into that. Don’t think anyone ended up sleeping with anyone either, but it was still fun, probably.

I had a buffet at the Gopala Restaurant in Juhu after my beach excursions, one night. Another spent walking around marine drive, and at the wine bar, but drinking coffee. Still working on all the projects.

I was sitting at the back centre of the hotel cafe, writing something on my dairy. When Shakey comes up to me, and says “a girl’s here, she would be perfect for you.” Look there—> a girl in a blue dress scribbling something on her diary while sitting up tight. She seemed aware. The cutest face, like a cat with boyish cut brunette but kinda goldish hair. Zoned in on the dairy. I told him “Not everyone who’s writing in a dairy is supposed to be my type.” I didn’t want to disturb her. It seemed impolite with everyone already doing this. He made a strange face. As did Mr. Ramani, who was also sitting around, and couple of other people. What?! In a few minutes, she slowly got up, and walked away with her head up tight, right from in front of me.

We had a call with Vani about coming onboard Hex. She seemed more than interesting, but also herself. Trying to take over. Anyway, we were in touch.

Next day, I spent doing more of the same. In the night, I went out for drinks alone to Social Powai. There was a couple who kept showing interest in me, what are their intentions I thought?! A girl in a red dress followed me as I went downstairs to take a call. She was with a boy already, and too young. I did see her but did not speak. She also made a face. Alright! It was Vani calling to ask me to make a rough sketch of the three main characters from Hex. I was like, what is her problem?! Right now? She’s not even on the project yet. lol. Ashwin said to just do it. Alright. I waked to the nearby Tata Starbucks. Thought, I will spend few hours there, then go back to the hotel or the Airport Tata Starbucks. That same couple followed me to there! Sat right beside me. We had a little small talk. Weird, I thought. So, I took off immediately, and came back to the hotel.

It’s past mid night, I am sitting on this chair in the corner from where you could see the whole front desk. But it was just a comfortable spot with enough mind space, and without distraction of the window seat. This annoying guy from Chattisgarh was sitting beside me as I was working on this rough sketch, even though had already sent it to Vani. 

In come the came notebook girl in her blue dress, head held up tight like she owns the place, and the whole universe. She went into the women pods, but emerged right back, and towards the cafe kitchen to fetch hot water for her tea. Asked If I could watch over it, and she would be back in a second. She put the mug on the table in front, there were only two tables in this spot. I didn’t use to take guarantee of anyone else’s stuff, but couldn’t say no to her. Fine.

She came back, sat there doing something with the tea, and slowly drinking it. She’s Anna from Russia, and I am Rohit from everywhere.

This annoying guy asks her if she would bring him vodka from time she’s coming back from Russia. Anna and me, both looked at each other, and started laughing uncontrollably. It was life someone had lifted a rock, some heavy weight off the whole world. It was lovely again. This guy left. It was just wonderful being in her presence. We were just talking about anything. I am finally trying to impress her.

Then comes Shakey with some bag in his hand. I introduced them, yeah. Not insecure. Made a joke about him carrying drugs in that bag. We all laughed. He also went away.

I offered to show her around the next day, she kinda agreed, but said she’s busy during the day. Of course, I would wait for as long as possible. I kinda slept, but not really. Came to the cafe right after the breakfast, she was not there. Mr. Ramani asked me for some money, usually I don’t but he looked genuinely in need, So i did. 

Sat on the other corner, next to the windows. She emerged out of the women’s pod but went into the these booths for a video conference. Didn’t even look at me. I kept looking at her, couldn’t take my eyes off. Shakey had joined me on the adjoined sofa. At the end of her video conference, she walks toward me, and sits on the perpendicular sofa. Shakey is trying to make chit chat with her, while I am like how much more fun I can make of you before you go away asshole! lol. I also kept talking about this place where time and space have no meaning, she liked that. Helped her with her train ticket to Delhi, put her email on it, and stuff. Then Gaurav comes it, trying to ask her out as well! Is it open season here?! I was on top of my game. We decided to go out. But then Shakey was going to tag along. I will puke right now. Like hell, he’s coming with us. Are you kidding. I was giving him signals, but he’s not taking any. She went to get ready, we were going to go to the wine bar in Colaba. 

But she was taking forever to get ready! It’s been an hour. I told Shakey, that she’s not coming, let’s go ourselves. Couple of his tourist friends came in then, he’s chatting with them. Then she emerged from the women’s pod looking like a Queen. I was ready to kill Shakey, if he had insisted on tagging along. But he was in his right mind, decided to instead go out with the tourist. She half heartedly asks him if he’s gonna be sad, I literally pulled her out of the hotel at that point.

It was too late to travel to Colaba. She said “let’s go wherever it’s easy.” We took an auto rickshaw because it was available immediately, and I didn’t want to wait there any longer. Though she was expecting a cab, she’s always expecting a cab. It’s Mumbai, my Queen! I was not in love yet, or didn’t realise it at least. But highly infatuated.

We were talking about architecture, and roads for some reason as the auto rickshaw reached Powai Bridge. I mentioned Barack Obama’s text about we all being inter dependent on each other, and those who came before us. She said “Obama” like in a funny way, we laughed and, she tells me about being divorced. That’s alright. It was already like I had known her forever. It was not uncomfortable at all. But I was not thinking about it then.

As we entered Powai, asked her If she would like to have Italian Food? Because that’s the first restaurant on the way to the inner Hiranandani compound.

We got off before entering the market, like I usually do because of the traffic, and I like walking. She also liked walking. We decided on Social Powai to start with, being really hungry. There was an empty table at the end of the hall, beyond the drinking area. We took seats, consulted on the food, and ordered some snacks. I suggested something to drink, but she said “Don’t tell me what to do” with so much authority. I was a little scared of her, and so much infatuated. The food was not that great actually, and too much sound. She was the first one to complain about it being too noisy. Well, he can move! She was a little surprised, don’t know why. I went for a quick leak, and paid the bill. Came back and told her we are not going to pay, and to follow me. She looked scared but agreed! lol. She didn’t offer to pay the bill or anything. She’s my girl. As we were sneaking out, she walking right behind me, looking really concerned, I looked at her cute face, eyes and told her I already paid. She lovingly pinched me on the side, as we walked out of that place.

We are walking towards the inner compound of the Hiranandani market, she seemed more relaxed. Asked if she would like to trespass to the roof of this building, and she agreed to that as well. We acted like a couple, the security never questions us, took the elevator to the top floor, there was an old man who got in the elevator along with us, and got off before us. The elevator dropped us somewhere before the top floor. There was no access. We were actually trespassing! lol. Took the elevator back to the ground floor, kept acting like a couple. It was all fine as we walked out of the building.

We kept walking, and arrived at this round about with a black statue of something. Admired it for a while for some reason as Anna told me something really impressive about Georgia. Okay. We took a table at another fancy restaurant in the corner of that same round about. We were going to have wine, but settled for tea and, coffee. We also ordered some deserts, but did not finish it. I didn’t know what to say, just wanted to keep listening to her wonderful voice. Kept looking into the eyes. She got a phone call, won’t leave her bag behind, so she doesn’t trust me, I thought. That’s alright. We are still only strangers. I got a phone call from home about nothing. We decided to move from that place as well.

Anna said she wants to buy something for her friends in Delhi. This guy she met on a flight from Nepal, then met in Hyderabad, some wannabe pilot. I knew pretty much about her whole trip by now in her own words. She felt comfortable sharing even the little details. Of course, i made fun of this dude as we’re shopping at this supermarket, still acting like a couple. She didn’t actually wanna buy anything. lol. I tried some sun glasses, she had the shopkeeper take our photo.

She started running around this flee market, I was compelled to chase her. It was lovely, we went around almost the whole place till I spilled, but she caught me! We locked eyes, it’s usually the other way around, but who cares?! It was a wonderful moment. I stood up, both were a little jilted in a good way.

It took some convincing but she agreed to visit this rooftop restaurant I used to come sometimes with Khushbu, and Gaurav. Originally, it was this restaurant she wanted to visit when we decided on Powai for the night. I was walking facing her, trying to impress with something, and also thinking, she’s a little taller, but thats fine.

We reached Breeze, the rooftop restaurant in our own playful way, and took seats at the glass railings. It’s a movie and we are two characters. You get a wide view of the city from that position, it’s beautiful, also a bit surreal seeing all those people locked in their little holes. Some of the posh buildings there have town halls rather than pent houses, i kept thinking about standing on one of those roofs. She was still apprehensive of ordering drinks, I knew it was safe, but who had told her that it’s not?! It’s natural for a tourist to be careful, didn’t take it personally at all. At the same time, I don’t like to brag at all, but she was in the safest company ever, Putin couldn’t have kept her safer. Had to push a little in the most friendliest ways for her to order a Black Russian, and i ordered the usual old fashioned. This time I even drank it. You order Black Russian if you don’t actually want to have an actual drink, and she didn’t even drink that properly. Fine. 

She told me a dick joke about Putin 🤣. We spoke about how I want to be “omnipresent”, that’s how much interested I was in people, and characters at that time. Everyone was getting X rayed. Everything was interesting in a melancholic tone, maybe it was my inner self reflecting a bit on the paper through humour. She told me about wanting to travel, but also being really tired, and needing rest. It was way past mid night. We stepped outside the rooftop restaurant, and walking on the main Hiranandani high road. On the way, I asked what is her fav movie, to which she said “The Handmaid’s Tail” which is not even a movie, but a series. That was another sign that something is going on in her mind. She not scared, because here we are walking alone on deserted roads. Then, what’s going on?! She just kept becoming more and more interesting as far as I was concerned.

Other than few autorickshaw walla’s, moon light, and the cosmos itself, there was no one else on the whole street. Completely deserted but with two people about to fall in love. Rickshaw walla’s are safe, but I had to do something to hold her hand as it didn’t seem appropriate to just grab it, we were not “there” yet. She was thinking something, while we were chit chatting. As we came closer to the bunch of rickshaws, i told her “hold my hand my if you want to be safe, otherwise they would think you are alone.” 😭😁 She instantly gave me her hand, I held it lightly. Like a billion stars just became supernova! I let go off her hand when we were past the rickshaw walla’s. Then asked to hold it when we were passing them by again. She said no! Folding her hands in protest. Really shy and cute. I asked if she would like to trespass into another building, and she didn’t like that idea either, and said I should not force her about trespassing. It was a little past 3am. We kept walking for a while more. That’s when she suddenly stood still, turned around, arranged her hair like someone arranging a bunch of galaxies together, and asked me to call a cab. Like she was my boss. Okay.

I was a bit disappointed, this was the best walk ever, and didn’t want it to ever end. The cab came within a few minutes and, we were back in the hotel. I got couple of bottles from the reception, gave one to her as we sat on the same table as yesterday night.

Anna was a bit more relaxed. Her deep emeraldish eyes were specifically radiant, complementing her makeup, and the dress in the low light of the cafe. She was looking cute like a button. I asked her about later today, she didn’t say anything for a while. Then started smiling, and said that I was naughty, and wanted everything right now. I was like Hmm, and smiled back. We were silent for a while, still gazing into each other’s eyes and, smiling. 

Then out of nowhere she said “Abu Dhabi.” 

What about it? 

“You make me think of Abu Dhabi.” 

You want to come with me?

She moved her head sideways like a little girl with the widest smile.

I like layers, and she has so many. This is when I fell in love with Anna. That exact moment. It did not matter who she was, could be lying about everything, could be honest, but she’s my girl. I knew she’s one a kind, my kind.

Even without sleep for two nights, I was not tired or sleepy, at least not feeling it yet. Even she mentioned about both of us not eating anything during the whole night out, not even finishing the drinks properly. Yeah. One could tell she was struggling with questions of her own.

It’s like someone had turned on a switch with abundant energy flowing between us. It had never happened like this before. Something similar happened before, but nothing like this. Everything vague, and even uninteresting started making sense. The massive crane, the ocean waves, life felt meaningful, but still something was missing.

I was at the breakfast waiting for her, she didn’t show up till little later. I was sitting with couple of people. Slightly drowsy, till she arrived. We shared phone numbers only then. She said something about last night, her eyes were really teary, it looked like crying. IDK. I asked her to not cry, it’s fine. Then she kept looking at this person sitting on my left for like a minute without blinking. Even he felt awkward. What are you doing?! I asked her out for lunch, she said after a nap, and went for a nap.

She then texted me to check for lunch. I do have patience 😁

Let’s go. I can’t get anything else done other than thinking about you, anyway. lol.

As we were leaving the hotel, Shakey walked past us on the street. We looked at him, and carried on towards our cab. She says he looks like some dog. I couldn’t agree more.

We decided Bandra would be best, and she tells me that she already visited. To some book shop where people can work. “will check it out” I said. We first went to ‘Kitchen Garden’, it was too congested. So, we walked to another place around the corner called ‘Eat Around the Corner.’ She liked this much better. 

But just when we were about to enter through the front gate, she said “No more role playing, we will be ourselves.” Well. You asked for it. lol. I didn’t exactly know how to be myself. Remember being frozen for a few seconds when she said this. Took me 5 mins to think what that even means?! I was pretty confused for rest of the lunch thinking, why she had to say that? She kept looking at me during this whole time with so much hope, even in her body language as I am still struggling with this existential question in the middle of everything—> Who am I?

Could barely finish the sandwich. She wanted to go to the beach, and was again disappointed when I called for a autorickshaw instead of a cab. Juhu beach was nearby, it would have taken another 10 min to wait for the cab. I was pretty much a Mumbaikar at this point 🤷🏽‍♂️. 

Still a little uneasy, trying to be “myself.” Don’t know why I even took it so seriously?! Because she said it with so much authority, maybe. It was not like, “consider this.” But more like “That’s what you gotta do.”

Anna is an English teacher, she had an online class in a few hours, and is now considering cancelling it. Because I convinced her that we will have fun. She said “I want to have fun.” We are on the road that leads to Juhu beach when she folds her arm around mine, but I am frozen for some strange reason, and till this day don’t know why I said this—> “I can’t save you.” She retrieves her arm, visibly angry. Saying “I don’t want to be saved, Just wanted a hug.” I apologised, and said the same thing that I don’t know why I said that!!! She’s sitting with her arms folded, knees on the railing of the autorickshaw. Won’t let me touch her. The stupid autorickshaw driver asks her to sit properly because of the cops. This made her even more angry. She calls me a nerd. lol. Basically wanted to throw me, and the driver out of the rickshaw. Pretty much.

Don’t yet know “who I am?” But now I am getting to know the real Anna. lol. She almost jumps out of the rickshaw as I paid the driver, and ran to catch up to her.

We walked through the main Juhu beach entry point. There’s a lot of uneasiness now. The vibe has shifted from a lovely romantic couple to two individuals struggling with themselves, caught up in confusion.

She saw some people getting into the sea with their clothes on as people do at this beach. And asks if she can go swim naked in the beach. Well, of course, but not here! Where is this question even coming from? I didn’t yet know anything about Russian women’s continuous quest for freedom, and liberty in the oppressive male dominated state. Well, patriarchy is not that different in India, but you are judging me based on an awkward situation. I am not that kinda nerd! I am cool, baby! 🤣

I am falling more, and more in love with her through all this. She trying to be tough, but is so vulnerable. 

Shoes in our hands, slowly, and silently walking at the edge of the ocean and earth, leaving our foot prints behind to only be washed up by the incoming waves. She is spending all this time coming up with ways to judge me, while I am walking right behind her like we are connected by some unseen thread.

She says we should at sit this spot to watch the sunset. Okay. You are definitely the boss. As we sat on the sand looking at the sun going down, she asks me a bunch of questions to check if I was insecure. I was not, but you are, I thought. Obviously, I couldn’t say this to her. lol. She’s talking about this and that person from the pods. I don’t care, just want her to not get into any trouble knowing most of the people there. But told her it’s upto her. Do as you like. I tried holding her hand, and its the first time she uses these words that I’ll keep hearing several times “There’s a boundary.” What does that mean?! I don’t touch anyone if they don’t want to be touched. We are not in a relationship either. So, I can’t touch her until she takes away this fuckin “boundary.” Getting a bit annoyed myself now. Why are you giving such a massive reaction to a small strange incident?! 

As the sun is setting down, we get up, I am still trying to convince her, but she’s way over her head, and gives me a pity walk around, and a fake hug from behind. Could tell by her body language. Still beautiful, and wonderful. This was the most beautiful sunset of my life. In fact, i had not felt beauty of the sunsets before this moment. Anna looked so beautiful with the light glow of the setting sun, and the ocean behind her.

But common, you are taking all of this in a wrong way.

As we started walking, she refuses to go for dinner to the wine place where time and space meets! Says she will take her class, and then go to some stupid party arranged by Shakey! I had already declined his invitation. 

I tell her “Fuck you, Anna” with as much disdain as possible.

She says “I like that”

“Still, fuck you.” 

She says “I will call you from Taj Palace Hotel when I am here next time.”

“Fuck you and I really mean it”

There’s silence as we leave Juhu Beach.

She waits as I take my time to tie the shoe laces.

We walk upto the nearby Tata Starbucks as that’s where I have called the cab. She insists on buying me a drink, it’s her way of saying good bye. I refused to take anything from her. She’s still bossing me around, and says to take whenever someone is giving a gift. For sure. I was refusing because I knew this is what she does, because she herself told me a story about some other encounter. I am thinking, what a bitch. But I still love her. She also buys a pack of mouth freshener for herself, and offers me some. Kept asking about the cab. Well, i tried to delay it as much as possible, but had to finally relent.

We get into the cab, i am thinking about ways to save this. I love her, and this is all because of a ridiculous non incident! She’s still mad about that as apparent from her conversations, still calling me names. Maybe, if I tell her about my grand plan?! So, i told her about using the money from the film business to build a spaceship to travel the cosmos like really seriously. lol. Of course, it’s making little actual or practical sense, but what the fuck?! I gotta do something, anything! I don’t talk about all this with anyone else because they would think I am nuts. But to the women I love who’s calling me a nerd. Why not?! lol. 😂 

In a way, we traveled a whole galaxy in that short journey from Juhu Beach to the Urban Pod Hotel.

After Sunset—>

I am sitting alone in the cafe, thinking what just happened when Mr. Ramani asks me if it’s alright?! No. But I don’t want to talk about it. She comes to the cafe with her laptop, and sits on the chairs perpendicular, but leaving a block in between, unlike last time. 

Overheard some people at the cafe including Mr. Ramani are discussing the situation among themselves, “it looks like they had a fight.” They ask me again, but still don’t have answers. Then surprisingly Anna walks upto me, and asks if I want to go to this party with her? Well, sure. She again asks me to call a cab! I was about to ask her to book it herself, but anyway. I still love her.

She tells me that Shakey told her that she won’t be able to get there on her own. Okay! I am trying to impress upon her with some more based stuff during the ride to the party location. It’s somewhere in Malad. 

We arrive to find it’s not a party at all, but a four people dinner with Shakey, his friend and two of us. WTF. She got me in a situation I had been trying to avoid for long. You want to have dinner with Shakey?! And, I am nerd?! It’s the tackiest of restaurant as well. Shakey is trying to flirt with her, though I could tell she’s catching everything, and using it on him itself. While our real chemistry is shinning through pretty well, for him to say “it looks like something is going on between you too.” Yeah. Thank god Ash called me for the longest unnecessary call ever, talking about “business.” I paid on her behalf, she’s surprised by that for some reason.

Then she tells me that we are going for a ride to that place I had told her about. Well, that’s definitely closed by now. We thanked Shakey for the dinner. lol. They exchange Instagrams. Alright, let’s go! She tells me wanting to do some social work as she knows this women activist but not having the energy for it. Hmm. She liked my voice while speaking to the cab driver in Hindi. Okay. I am just happy she’s around.

We arrive at marine drive, and sit at the concrete slabs facing the sea for a short while, before getting up for coffee. I am not too sure, what to do with all the confusion of keeping a boundary as told earlier today. She makes me pay for the coffee, which is a nice development. As we start walking again, she tells me “I like to fight for my rights.” 

Alright. What?! 

And, replied “You like to fight for your rights?” 

She cutely nods. 

I am thinking—> what fuckin rights?! 

So, is she saying we can’t have casual sex or we can?! I haven’t proposed her yet. What rights are we talking about?

I take time to catch the drift, followed by exponential growth. It’s no different here. Already not properly slept, and totally confused about all kind of things. Not confused about her, but how to approach so that I am not breaking any boundaries, she doesn’t have to fight for any rights, and also being my true self! Easy 🙄

Anna is continuously talking about all kinds of things and people. I am listening with as much attention as I have. She had bought mentos from the cafe, and offers me one. That’s a clear sign of a girl asking you to kiss her! But I am not sure about her reaction. What if thats breaking the boundary or something else?! My inner self is screaming, just grab, and kiss her, but the more thoughtful self is telling me to not do anything unless she makes an actual physical move herself. It’s the biggest paradox facing mankind, and I have to face it! 

I uses to keep humming Suzanne by Leonard Cohen all the time, she noticed, and said liked the tune.

The streets were deserted. No one’s there, other than a garbage truck as we walk up to Flora Fountain. It’s another round about. I make a joke about my d**k to lighten the mood. She laughs. It’s good. There are police cars all around. Her sweet pink lips are calling me out like magnets, but I have a lot of control. Can’t afford to get in any trouble. She has a call from a Russian female friend, shows her the surroundings, minus me. Hmm. Asks me to call a cab again. Really tired as we get in the cab. I take a huge sigh, and say “this seat is really comfortable.” She asks about my constant sighing. Well, I am under slept, and maybe it’s the pollution. “You are a really good listener” she says. Okay. 

During all of this i have come to a probability that maybe she wants to get married and, thats why she’s talking about fighting for her rights?! So, I ask her “Do you want to get married again?” 

She says “maybe.” Followed by if she finds the right person, and all.

Aahhh. I had no plans to get married till that point. But now I am thinking “maybe, something to consider.” 

We come back to the hotel. Prashant is behind the desk. We are standing beside each other. She’s expecting something. I was still not sure about anything. With the help of hand gestures, she says that before meeting me her Mumbai experience was really bad, but after meeting me, it’s been the best. I was happy to hear that, let’s keep it that way! 

We can’t sleep together because that might violate her rights? So, I take my pod Keys, and walk upto the locker to keep my shoes. She says “You are so small.” 

Okay, so you were expecting me to book a private room! But don’t need to insult me, because I am not yet sure about making any commitment. I didn’t say any of this. Just gave her one of the sighs with the smile, and took my seat at the furtherest corner in the cafe. Just before she was about to get inside the women’s pod, she turns around. Of course, I am looking at her. She smiles, looking like an absolute goddess. I said “Paka Paka”, which means goodbye in Russian language. She wants something, it’s all over her face, I also wanted something, both are afraid to say it.

Didn’t sleep the whole night. I didn’t want to be alone without Anna, but she was leaving tomorrow. There was also all this confusion between us. I had never felt something as strongly as this. Ended up talking to Mr. Ramani about philosophical issues as he was the only one up all night in the cafe. Lol.

Anna asks me to call a cab again. We were to go out for breakfast before leaving for Mumbai Central. It was another one of her things to say goodbye. I knew this idiot Shakey had been texting her as I saw him leaving the hotel while trying to avoid me. The hotel staff of taking time in checking her out because of some black patch on the sheet. There was no black patch. They were just bothered to see us together for some reason.

At POETRY in Powai, we ordered pan cakes, and beverages. I was just sad that she was going to leave. She was hiding whatever she was feeling behind a mask of being “fun.” It was so apparent, and unlike her. She again tells me about the boundary, and tried to pay for the breakfast. But I was regular at this place, and paid even before she knew, which surprised, and impressed her?! 

We walk a little around Hiranandani. I ask to not go, and that we will have fun. She asks me to slow down. I had never been in a real relationship. She had been just out of a divorce which was her only relationship. We are both afraid to commit. We are both in love. Both don’t trust each other completely. Do atoms have trust issues?!

We got out of the cab standing outside. She says “my bag is upstairs.” 

Do you want me to get it?

She thinks for a second and says “Why would you get my bag? I will get my bag. You call the cab.”

So, I called a cab.

She took slightly longer than expected.

We are sitting on the back seat. She’s making some reel. Still hiding behind the mask of being cool. I am all sad. I told her that I’ll never forget her. During the conversation she asks me “Are you gay?” 

“What?! Where’s that coming from?!” 

Now the real Anna shows up. Angry. Okay, so thats why she’s acting so fake! 

I try to hold her hand. “Don’t touch me” She said. In a way thats punishment for not touching her last night. She again tells me about this boundary, this time with her hand up. In fact, she gives me a little lecture on keeping boundaries.

Well, you keep doing this, and calling me gay?! Do you have any self awareness? I am thinking. I need to break this fourth wall, but she’s leaving as well. This is all so sudden!

Have a meeting with Disney Hotstar on 16th December, so I am not thinking of leaving. Money could help with my confidence, and many other things.

The day before, Akash from SixD called asking to attend a meeting in Hyderabad. She was supposed to visit Hyderabad in a few days. So I am thinking of seeing her there.

I basically don’t know what to do to keep Anna forever with me, and thats making me really sad. It was like I had finally found my soul, and someone is taking her away.

She wants to buy some sweets for her hosts in Delhi. There’s a shop across the road from the station. I offer to go get it, but she hands over her suitcase to me, and walks towards the shop. Took about 15 minutes. Didn’t buy anything. I joke about running away with her suitcase, “it’s only panties inside” she joked. Haha.

We are inside Mumbai Central, I am pushing her suitcase. The train is already on the platform. I take the charge of finding her coach, she’s right behind. 

“I couldn’t have done it without you.” She says. 

“Of course, you would have. It’s not that difficult.” I replied.

We found her coach. She trying to place her bag. I sneak out, hiding behind the outside door of the train. Wanting to see her reaction. She calls me out, couldn’t find, and is really angry, worried. I emerge out of hiding, she is so relieved. Trying to hide behind the mask again “what are you doing there?!” She’s standing outside the coach. I join her there. She hugs me goodbye, and says “don’t be naughty.”I start to walk away in a bit. She goes inside the train. I can’t just walk away like this.

Turned around, and walked inside her coach. Wanted to kiss her, but there were people in the coach. She was sitting on the lower berth, i hugged her, and said “Thanks for saving me, Anna” She had some kind of relief on her face and, said “aaww, you saved yourself” in the most cutest ways. Then she tells me that Shakey told her that he’ll be coming to say goodbye at the station as he had some work nearby. I was not surprised. But didn’t care in that moment.

I just don’t want to leave her alone, don’t want her to go. “You want to come to Delhi with me?” She asks cutely, and most vulnerable she’s been. Expecting me to say yes. “I don’t have a ticket” I said. The train started moving. I will call you. We hug, and I step out. Kept looking at the train even after it left the station. My soul’s on a train. WTF had happened?!

I called Shakey on the phone, asking him why couldn’t he make it? Ask him to meet me at the station. He fidgeted a little, but came. This meeting was a warning for him in the most subtle ways to not step on my toes. Asked him to book a cab. On our way to the hotel. I am just aghast from her going away. Thinking about a place where I could completely utilise all my senses without thinking about Anna, if that was even possible —> a film set. That’s the only place I wanted to be in that moment.

Sent her a poem during her train journey, originally read on [https://www.themarginalian.org/](https://www.themarginalian.org/about/)—> 

“How should we like it were stars to burn
With a passion for us we could not return?
If equal affection cannot be,
Let the more loving one be me.

Admirer as I think I am
Of stars that do not give a damn,
I cannot, now I see them, say
I missed one terribly all day…”

By W H Auden

She told me about being really tired, and trying to sleep.

Couldn’t be at a film set, and just couldn’t spend anytime at any of the places I had been with ANNA including the hotel because she would keep flashing in front of my eyes. Really missing her. I was spending more time in the Tata Starbucks at the Airport. I could take a flight, and go anywhere, whatever. Felt a little better being so close to the airplanes. Didn’t want to be anywhere without her. It was no longer the ‘fictional city of Bombay’ in her absence, but only Mumbai.

We were in sporadic touch on WhatsApp, she was a bit more relaxed being living with the family of her friend in Vasant Kunj, Delhi. I pretty much knew everything about them from her already, along with when she had a flight back to Russia, and even who she’ll be staying with for a few days in Moscow upon arrival 🥰. She was looking for safety, and comfort. My baby had the mask of being tough back on 😭. She tells me that we should let the relationship take a natural course. So, we are in a relationship? I thought. I offered to travel to Rajasthan together, but she threw another curveball towards me while I was already struggling with all the other things she had said! lol.

In btw, she had changed her profile photo on WhatsApp right after our time together, and had posted something on instagram about finding the perfect person in the universe, but with concerns about intimacy. Not in those exact words, but you get it 😁

I was dreaming for us to find a bag full of money somehow to travel the world together 🥺🤣, it felt so free, like I had been given proverbial wings, they were just in Delhi with her, for now. 

Inquired with Akash about Hyderabad, but he refused to provide air tickets or any expenses. Like, are you nuts wanting me to attend a meeting on your behalf by spending my own money?! GTFO.

Shakey and Chikee were spending time with me at Tata Starbucks, and the hotel. Had a call with Vani, and Ashwin to get her onboard Hex. She said the script lacked emotional touch, which was completely not true. I knew who was speaking these words on her behalf, those who didn’t actually understand scripts—> Sanjay and co. If you don’t even have your own feedback by reading the script, then everything you say is pretty much irrelevant, but she wanted to take over creative development! I did not disrespect her, though could not take it seriously. There was discussions between her, and Ashwin of a payment arrangement for her to come on board. I thought if these people have ever put an actual project together?! We can have some understanding, but even she’s not bringing any funding to the table! Will she be able to bring someone onboard for Visual Development? No. Ashwin is already doing all that. He himself had similar views, we pretty much agreed on everything, and left it open ended.

Ashwin had also got in touch with a content commissioner at Netflix, India through Prabhav. I was also included in the communication this time. Last communication we had from Alexi of Netflix Animation or Hex was in September, and were hoping to push them with some visual + overall development.

We had initiated conversations with a bunch of other companies as well. I had already written first draft of ‘The Moon Project’ and was trying everything to somehow force start it into principal photography.

Anna had some plans to travel. I was not insecure, because knew her this much. But It felt like If she’s travelling, then I should as well. Maybe, she’ll come join me, i thought. Made plans to travel after the meeting with Disney Hotstar. Emailed Manisha to confirm, but she postponed the meeting to January new year. Great. I was free to travel. Shakey thought I was being impulsive. I appreciate he’s trying to help, but at the same time he’s also a lustful asshole. Overall too naive, if not idiotic to think that I did anything impulsively, even if it looked like that. I was telling everything to him, so he would share it with Anna. Knew he’s numb nut, not loyal, and she didn’t like surprises. Just wanted to be with Anna.

What could be more exotic, and something that will pull her out of her current plans?! Ladhak! But plane tickets to Ladhak were crazy expensive! Also, i was running out of money, had over spent a bit in the last few days. Could not afford Ladhak on the whole, definitely not if she was going to join. Still gotta impress my girl, I thought 🥺. Maybe, I could just get there to show her my adventurous ways, then we could settle on somewhere affordable 🤷🏽‍♂️. 

Told Anna that I am travelling to the mountains, and invited her to join, but there was again some excuse. She advised me to get proper clothing for winters from Decathlon. For sure, I even tried to find it in Mumbai but it was too far. Ended up buying a jacket from H&M at Inorbit Mall, Malad.

Back at Airport Tata Starbucks, Shakey came to see me off. Think i had read an article about Covid 19 starting to spread. Trying to scare him. lol. He just believed everything like living in the glacier for the rest of my life, because of Anna’s betrayal 😂. Sure, I was deeply in love, but common.

Arrived early morning at the Indra Gandhi International Airport while listening to “Can’t help falling in Love” by Elvis Presley. Spent about 3 to 4 hours drinking Americano at Tata Starbucks at the arrival terminal. Then I went home, but just could not stay there. Wanted to be out there. Had no hotel bookings or anything. Just took off, and caught a bus for Dehradun.

I was going to try to go to Ladhak anyway. Thought Satyam could help, because he operated in the same area. Just put me on some vehicle to Ladhak or something. But he didn’t reply. All the glaciers were inaccessible without proper bookings. Also, i was not really prepared. Arrived early morning at Dehradun. So, i slept at a hotel in Dehradun for few hours only. There were some army people checked just few minutes after me in the other rooms. Felt safe. The hotel was not even 1 star. In the evening, I thought let’s go to Rishikesh, but there was no direct bus from Dehradun to Rishikesh. Had to take a bus to Haridwar, and a bus from there to Rishikesh. It was interesting to travel totally unhinged. That’s when you feel the local crowd and flavours.

Booked a hotel, spent a day in Rishikesh. It was nice. Especially the morning sun light. I had a new found deep appreciation for everything. Before it was about the mechanics, and the melancholy of things, but now it was also the beauty, soul and joy of little things. Couldn’t stay more than a day there either. Mountains seemed more appropriate.

Booked a bus from RIshikesh to Chandigarh to Dharamshala, Himachal Pradesh. Had never been there before this. It was raining on the way. 

The bus got us to Dharamshala at 2.30am before scheduled arrival. I had no hotel booked. Looked for nearby hotels on google maps, there were plenty, but was particularly close, right next to the petrol station⛽️. My hands were freezing, it was difficult to use the phone. Anyway, found the hotel. On a slight Plateau about 200 meters from the Main Street. The duty manager was sleeping on the couch covered with a blanket. No booking till 5am, he said barely looking out of his blanket. Really?! You are right here! 

I spent the night on an empty couch, but it was really cold, and didn’t have a blanket. When it came time to book the room, he said only cash! I didn’t have enough cash at hand. Found some ATM’s nearby. Give me the room now!

The hotel room was really toned down version of the room was 2001: A Space [Odyssey.](http://Odyssey.It) I was the only one staying at this hotel. The hallways, and the rooms were all empty. Anyway. Being really tired, i slept like a baby for like 3 hours. But when I woke, it was like I had woken up from dead. lol. Just the surrealness of the sunlight filtering through the tree just outside the window, the snow clapped mountains in the background, slight dew on the ban on railing, and silence of that place with birds chirping can heal anyone—>

Couldn’t help but share the photos with Anna, she seemed to like it. But still cagey. Well. I don’t impose, and can’t blame her either for choosing what felt best for herself. Missing her for sure, but I wasn’t even thinking all that. You gotta act on love. Can’t leave it for later. 

![c5aaaf3e-9f05-4aa1-a3b2-d700a87faedc.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Bollywood%20Edition%20Part%203%E2%80%94%20Perso%2067401a9209224b05a1c1b3888f63ce4d/c5aaaf3e-9f05-4aa1-a3b2-d700a87faedc.jpeg)

I couldn’t even recall her face properly. But her energy just won’t leave me, it felt like she was beside me all this time. Kinda magical. Moved to a more happening area in a couple of days known as McLeod Ganj, and this Buddhist cafe there which became my main hangout point.

Stayed in few hotels there. Watched some sunsets, alone but not lonely. Wandered around in the mountains.

We had been in touch with Darren Wall of Chase Imagination/ now Planet Jump Productions to come on board for visual development of Hex, and had a call re that with him and Ashwin. Darren is a storyboard artist himself, also 2d animation director, therefore, it made more practical sense talking to him about coming aboard for visual development. There is no need for comparison between him and Vani. We wanted her involved as well, but not to run creative development. Collaborate creatively? yes. As a producer? yes. 

Also, had a call with Netflix India re all of our projects. It’s strange, I was in Mumbai like a week back, and it’s all happening when I am here in the mountains. Obviously had a ton of new ideas to write about during all this. 

The CA said that its important to submit some stupid thing for the company, it made no sense at the end of the year. Are you purposely trying to make my life difficult. Sent them the money from there itself. Shakey messaged me thinking i had moved to Dharamshala. What?! lol. He had the most outlandish takes.

Anna said she after visiting Hyderabad in a new days, she would be spending the new year with her friend. Who am I now?! You are choosing to spend the New Year with someone one else. This does not seem like a relationship. At least not the ones I know about. But we could meet in Delhi. 

Anna travelled to Taj Mahal, Agra during this and was going to travel to other places in the north with this wannabe dude from Vasant Kunj. 

Okay. Suddenly, it’s all so formal. I don’t like too much formality. Like to keep it real. I am also getting an inclination that she’s thinking as if I am one of her boys like the Delhi dude or Hyderabad dude or Shakey?! Well, I am not. Don’t know whats all that is about, fine if they are only friends, but thought she should address it.

Back in Delhi. We decided to meet at the Hauz Khas Village. I suggested The piano man but had been there already. Again, she was so formal in setting up the date. That’s not like you, but fine. People can sound different in digital communication. 

I am excited to meet her, maybe change the new year plans 🤷🏽‍♂️. Waiting at Social, Hauz Khas. Spoke to her cab driver for directions. She arrived looking like absolute stunner in whatever she was wearing. Again cute as a button. I just forgot all about new year, or to even speak. It’s just her energy, that makes me so relaxed, like I don’t even feel the need to talk. All my senses calm. It’s MaGical! 

We try to settle, move between tables, but she decides to take a walk around the market. Says the new haircut is looking good as we are getting down the elevator. Thanks. I compliment her hair in return, though she didn’t get a haircut 🤣. 

She’s telling me about her Agra trip. How she wanted to spend a day alone, but the dude could not get a train, and stayed back. “And then we…..” she didn’t complete the sentence. Why would you say that?! And, what are we doing here then?! I thought. Didn’t want to judge. Then, she’s looking for a gift for this dude’s sister. And acting like its to keep her away. Okay?! Are you this awkward all the time, i thought. Reading between the lines, it seemed like she’s kidding. But at the same time, are you not at all self aware or are you just nuts? That’s not funny at all.

It’s still light hearted, but of course I am confused. Not exactly sure unless she addresses all this properly. Freedom is one thing, but this is really an awkward way to judge someone.

As we come out of the gift shop, she introduces me to her friends, a Russian couple. They just happened to be standing there. Upon telling him that I am writer, he said “mysterious.” Ha. Well, not that mysterious, have pretty much nothing to hide, other than the work for commercial reason. But I was fine, and even liked people having that image of myself. Nothing to lose, and saves you all the explaining because it’s all “mysterious.” lol.

We part ways with the couple. She tells me they owned the guest house in Nepal where she had stayed.

Chose a restaurant with a rooftop, overlooking the lake, its a nice place. We ordered tea, but it’s cold. Ask them to replace it, and we also move inside, on the first floor. This is more comfortable. I joked about knowing KGB agents. She’s thinks it’s serious for a second. Ordered food. I am just really troubled thinking about all these things, and wanting to have a real thing with her. Loss of words, doesn’t feel comfortable addressing it. 

We are having a relatively nice conversation. There are some jokes. We talk about my financial situation briefly. She wants to read my diary where I have written something about her, and finds it judgemental. Is a bit offended. Why do you have such polarising reaction to everything, I thought. That’s what I did at that time, write about people. Not supposed to be judgemental, it’s trust that I am letting you read, and supposed to be helpful. I want us to open up to each other. Maybe, not the best of times to share. It’s fine. I felt like being in a place where I don’t get offended by anything she does or says. Subconsciously, I am processing all of this. 

I was not able to finish the falafel sandwich. She had competed her meal.

As we are walking downstairs, she says “you are wearing a really nice jacket, and look at my clothes.” She looked great! That’s the only jacket I have. I offered her my jacket. “What will you wear?.”

We visit a jewellery/ Antique store called Bana Studio. I am just curious, she’s looking at rings, I ask if she wants to buy one? She’s so subtle. We have little small talk with the owner, an old couple, they advise her about which rings will be great. I don’t have the money, and I am not there yet. We are still not completely open with each other, she was right, let’s get there naturally, but we need to transparently talk with each other without masks. One of the rings is Rs. 40,000.00 which is not much at all, even a noise about jewellery like myself knows this, but I don’t really have that kind of money. “Maybe when Netflix buys one of the projects” I said. Got her a pair of affordable earrings, and another that she liked without telling her. If there’s anyone I want to buy a ring for its Anna, when we are there, properly.

She suggests that we should be on our way. Had told me all the stories from her adventures since I left her at the train. She asks me to get my bike. I stopped ridding bikes almost 15 years ago. lol. Why do you have that image of me?! 😆 Would like to ride some cool super bike, but, it’s not a heavy desire. Called a cab.

We are in the cab, talking random stuff, I again don’t want to be away from her. Tried to hold her hand, but she says there’s a boundary! Common now?! I had to explain that boundaries do not work like that! She’s looking for control. That makes her really angry. Throwing some other curveballs at me, brings up the dairy thing from earlier. There’s a silence. This is a good opportunity to give her the earrings, i thought. She was pleasantly surprised, and says “I like that.” We are really close now, her lips are within range, looking right into her eyes, about to reach…when the cab driver hits the brakes! And asks if this is where we want to be. She’s upset. “A little further.” Probably thinking I didn’t kiss her? I don’t know. 

We come out of the cab in front of the building she’s living with the family. It’s just the two of us. She asks “what do you want?”

“I love you” Rohit

“No you don’t, you can’t love anyone” Anna

“I do love you, Anna” Rohit

“You don’t even love yourself” Anna

That’s not true, and my maths tuition teacher from 9th grade can confirm this. lol.

“What are you saying?”

“You can’t love anyone” She’s really angry! 

I thought she was being cute.

“Do you even have a heart” She’s now poking at my chest with her beautiful finger. 

“Is there a heart in there? Huh huh” Anna still poking 

Wonderful, so there’s no boundary. lol.

I am smiling. She gets more angry. 

“You will find no place on earth, no place” she says looking frustratingly cute

“Then I will build a space ship, take you with me” i said 

“Fuck you” 

She storms away. Didn’t even care about the bushes. I thought that was funny as well. lol.

“Anna, Anna” I kept calling her name

A couple going into the same building heard me call her name. They told her that I am calling for her. lol. 

She knows already. Tells them something, and carries on into the building.

Of course, I felt devastated. But thought it’s just a fight. She clearly loves me. Will text her tomorrow.

There’s no point in making a scene. Called a cab, and on my way. 

No Place on earth—>

Didn’t feel like I should apologise, and set a bad precedent for the rest of our lives 🤷🏽‍♂️. Sent her random message to restart the conversation. 

She was still giving me lecture about “self love.”

Tried exploring it, and sent a relatively long essay in WhatsApp terms from the arrival terminal of Chhatrapati Shivaji Domestic Airport. It was gibberish to keep her engaged. 

On that flight from Delhi to Mumbai, my co passenger was Mr. Devendra Fadnavis, sitting right beside watching some action movie on his iPad. He was not chief minister at this time. We shook hands. He’s cool. I was not sure if it would be the right protocol to ask for his mobile number. lol. Had stopped working with Amtrak, and was no longer in the tender business either.

Didn’t think she really understood self love, so i tried contemplating it with her via texts. 

Why we were having that conversation rather than meeting? She was still in Delhi, but satisfied with the comfort of living with that family, it seemed from our conversations. Why are you satisfied with mediocre?! Everything about staying there was screaming average. Maybe, It was side effects of a long trip. Whatever. It’s no disrespect to that place or people, just different ways of looking at life. That’s all. 

I sent her some lovely messages, but she was having none of it. Only trying to preach. 

Corrected her about her ways, she didn’t like it, and blocked me. Narcissistic. That’s the first time anyone known had blocked me on WhatsApp ever. That too the person I love. 

#Added 27/06/2024—> Once before, Nimrat Kaur had blocked me straight away upon receiving a professional message when I got in touch with her for a role in the short film upon Surbhi’s recommendation and, she got the number from her casting director friend. Not blaming Nimrat. For the record.

That’s why I didn’t use to speak my mind with people, because no one likes facing their own self. But I love her, if I won’t save her then who would?! If we can’t be honest with the people we love then what is this all about?! Don't mind being hated for being myself. 

But then she was sending Christmas messages to Shakey. He was sharing screenshots. Travelling to Hyderabad to meet another idiot. I knew it meant nothing, but why is she doing all this?! Be strong, I thought.

Loving people is the only way to save them, and if she’s the only person I could save in the whole world, thats enough. 

It could be the miss world or miss universe, i don’t care, and get bored by everyone. Other than Anna.

Again changed her WhatsApp profile pic to something sad after blocking me. Also posting sad stuff on her social media like it’s al my fault for breaking her heart! Excuse me?!

She traveled with that idiot, and his sister during the new year for mediocre and average fun.

I went to the Indra Gandhi International Airport on the day she was supposed to leave. Well…did really felt like I no longer belonged on earth. Not without Anna.
