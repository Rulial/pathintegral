ðŸ’¡ This is a rewrite of a fictional story that I wrote during post graduation based on the basic idea of a kid wanting to become an astronaut and ending up building his own rocket ship. Rest of the details were added in time to make it a globally appealing cinematic masterpiece ðŸ˜­ which also shifted its potential viewership towards a matured audience, in essenceâ€”> when the inner child is not nurtured for the innocence it carries than the forces of hate could take advantage of our apathy to build an adult whoâ€™s embodiment of that hate because the inner child gets buried somewhere unredeemable. Location or particulars hardly mattered, it could have been about anyone or based anywhere.
