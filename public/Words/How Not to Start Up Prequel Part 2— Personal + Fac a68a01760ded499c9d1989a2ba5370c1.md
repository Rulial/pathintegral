It has always been about wanting to do things, building something particular and never about being this person or that person. There’s a big difference in these two ways of thinking. Let’s try!

December 2010

Arrived in London with a “permanent job” and nothing much else but about GBP 1400. Didn’t even have a place to stay other than the office as I didn’t have enough money for the deposit, also wanted to explore my options rather than live in some place like Ilford—> nothing wrong with the place itself but too far and not happening. Hadn’t figured out the whole hotel game yet.

It was not just me who didn’t have a place to stay, Jake also didn’t have a place or much money—> i didn’t know as to what happened?! He was living out of a dingy hotel. The basement office was not functional either, none of this was quite reassuring of a permanent job but Useless Ropner was still hanging around so I thought, alright, he’s gonna bankroll this thing! It was clear they did not have any actual project either at this time. My confidence already dwindling a bit, you know.

Anyway, i couldn’t have stayed at the office on that first night because Jake was gonna stay there. Had to call in a favour from a person I just did a favour by recoding crowd takes for a short film I had helped make for the passion of film making when things were a bit down—> even when all other things were going on. I like action 24 x 7.  Met Shinny Ahuja while doing the crowd takes for the short film because he was hanging around with few random people whom I asked to take part to record the crowd takes and yes, it was only a few days detached from the controversy. Anyway, i still had the tapes and probably that’s why Rikhil let me stay at his place in Harrow for one night because the next night he made some excuse.

Tried to find an accommodation from India itself but there was no positive reply from anyone including Tibo Travers, a friend from the post graduation class who also worked on Marty Unplugged as First AD even though he left before the wrap and there were problems with the schedule like not accounting for the day light—> it was his first time as First AD on a proper short film. We were in touch pretty much throughout the “exile” and even applied to Annecy for funding ‘Phil Was There’ with him as a producer. 

I tried staying the night in the office as Jake had moved to a hotel but the basement was cold, and there was an adjacent room along the office where the land lord used to stay some nights. I only got to know the next morning—> it was Colin in that room, who seemed like a nice guy when I first helped Jake and co move was apparently racially insecure. Anyway, he kept making strange noises throughout the night, the basement was also cold and dingy. I had no cover or a sleeping bag for the night either. This could have been a horror movie set… like Toolbox? or used as a location for the Hatch in LOST, but somehow made it through the night!

Jake’s father Mike and I painted the whole office during the day and fixed some general stuff around, i proposed a new table arrangement but we ended up with the usual wall to wall setup. In the evening i found a place to look at in Upton Park, it’s where WestHam United Football club is based. But that name and the football club are the only fancy things about this place—> its an immigrant hell hole on the outskirts of London but in Zone 3 which is better and cheaper to travel into the city compared to Zone 4 where I had lived previously. I was priced out of everything nearby the office with the “permanent job” salary. Jake did offer to help in the search but also gave up pretty quickly.

I was having second and third thoughts upon reaching the tube station itself but being an astronaut that way, some adventure and being able to save money was worth the pain. The house was near the Tube station, they were taking PG’s which meant no deposit among other reasons. I was expecting usual standards and cleanliness, you know, not too much to expect.

Found the house after some initial hiccups being first time around these parts but certainly not the last. I thought, this place would be occupied by like 1 family and they will have a room Or even a bed for the night. Thats all i needed as the luggage was still back in the office. Could see a slight yellowish light on the left side window and a drape covering it, i rang the bell and out came another movie character—> Manish Bhai, frail looking, shorter than me in height, light spectacles, a Gujarati. He would not look you in the eye and could instantly make out he was not absolutely comfortable interacting for some reason.

But It was a chawl/ a communal building on the inside with more than 15 people living there, the light on the left side was from a bathroom right next to the entrance and the whole place smelled dingy as hell. This place was a museum of dampness. It was late in the night and I had nowhere else to sleep, also Manish said only GBP 25 per night—> a deal breaker! There was an even better offer if one chose to stay for the whole week. He was really nice to me, even offered food for extra 5 pounds and quick introduction to few people around the house—> I established after a few more interactions that everything about him was transactional.

But I didn’t want to stay there other than for sleeping and politely declined the food offer. I remember making way to Tottenham Court Road, that was kinda my safe place, picked up a ready made pack of Pasta along with some chocolate, and walked around a bit before making my way back to Upton Park for the night. 

There were 5 other people in that room with me, if the walls weren’t rotten enough the bedding and the duvet made up for it. There were bed bugs, it smelled like they had just plucked it out of the rubbish bin, to say it was all uncomfortable would be an understatement. It was not like I was used to staying in palaces before this but they were relatively clean with no dampness. I will cover staying at other places with the stories from the house in Illford with my Marathi manus friends.

Somehow, I made it to the morning, and left the house without using the bathroom, to never come back again.

I was back that night itself. Brought some Prasadum with me from the Hare Krishna temple in Soho upon Alexey’s invitation to a religious function—> he apparently turned into a full devotee by this time. Manish didn’t touch the sweets till the morning though everyone else had it. He was quite cynical. 

This would go on for a week till I started paying weekly rent of £55 only as i could not find anywhere else this affordable. The idea was to spend minimum on accommodation as I already had a job and lot of other work of my own, only needed a place to sleep rather than to chill. The travel expenses were slightly less than the rent especially if I took the tube during the non peak hours i.e after 9.30am with a weekly travel plan.

Useless Ropner was really concerned with me coming to the office at around 10.30am rather than at 10am even though I explained the reason multiple times—> to save money because I was not being paid well enough. He was not a bad person per se but a bit too proud of himself, therefore, too judgemental of others as those attributes go hand in hand. Used to keep a book around his desk about Ropner’s dynastic lineage of ship building. 

Darren had shared information about a 3d Storytelling conference happening at Ravensbourne College in Greenwich. I made it known to Jake and Co, then attended it with Peter though Darren was not able to make it. Peter was even teaching me to eat with chopsticks at the college  restaurants and someone resembling Felicity Jones or herself?! Sitting alongside thought it was totally unnecessary. lol. I tried to bring the event organisers onboard ‘Phil Was There’ and also tried bringing some clients for Creation Film and TV.

Detour—>

Had been interested in action for Climate change for a while now especially to allocate proper drinking water and resources. Even been in touch with Scott Harrison, an entrepreneur running Charity: Water from NYC, providing clean drinking water in Africa. I messaged him in 2008 with a link to Ted Talks recommendation page, it was big back then 🤷🏽‍♂️ and he wanted to have a phone conversation. I thought, alright, maybe I can in fact help him somehow even though I was in Mumbai at that time working in a VFX company? You never know. But he thought I could actually recommend him to Ted, well…I could not and made it clear to him straight away that I had nothing to do with Ted Talks. Awkward. We never spoke again. Anyway, told that story because I had a meeting during this time with a company called ‘Smart Eco Build’ run by a Chinese or South Korean women by the name Miss. H. LiLing Lee, idea was to help Climate Action on the side but could not understand much of what she said during the meeting and afterwards their plans didn’t seem cohesive. Didn’t pursue it further.

Back to the future—>

I was really motivated coming into this phase and determined to make things happen, maybe I was a bit too motivated. If you have read [THE RAIN MAKERS—> Story + Personal](THE%20RAIN%20MAKERS%E2%80%94%20Story%20+%20Personal%20548a2785251144b3bf7cdb792eb7d0bf.md) then you know about my ambitions but I also learn and adapt. Had figured that I don’t have access to the kind of people who would back my global cinematic ideas especially in the UK, needed to find my way to Hollywood and make an independent feature film as a first step in that direction. Therefore, while doing all this, also started writing an independent film from India itself based on an idea that had been with me since I saw a short documentary about this on Discovery channel—> Miss Z, with a female protagonist based on a study about Out of Body experiences by Dr. James T Tart of Princeton University.

Had written a really lengthy treatment as I yet lacked confidence to write a feature film script and needed a team. I had been talking to Luke and Tibo about this film as three of us worked together on Marty Unplugged. I had worked with Tibo through the MA on different projects to have a certain comfort level though had known all along that he’s a bit cunning, envious and two faced. Again, not a bad person, still a friend but people are who they are and lack of self reflection makes them blind to their own shortcomings. It’s difficult to find perfect people anywhere, so as long as I had an awareness about him. Three of us met at the same Arts and Media centre building in Bloomsbury though both Tibo and Luke had a problem working with each other on the same team which was strange because neither of them had any money or contacts and we stood the best chance of pulling this off by working together as a team—> an English man, a French man and an Indian man on a mission to make Miss Z! That’s like an A team for the ages! lol.

Even though he exaggerated a lot, Jake had many contacts in the film business and we could leverage them if the project was in a presentable state. Did try convincing Jake to come onboard the Miss Z as a producer but even before I initiated the conversation, knew he works with a different mindset when it comes to making films—> it was more about earning the 10% producing fee and anything on top rather than the A24 or Fox Searchlight kinda long term independent film approach. It was also because he didn’t see me as a film director but more of his technical minion which I was not by any stretch of imagination.

Shared the treatment with both Tibo and Luke which they were supposed to read and get back with their feedback. Only Luke shared his feedback, Tibo did not. However, Luke definitely did not want to work with Tibo, so there was a choice to make. I was a bit apprehensive about having only Luke on the project because of his AWOL act during Marty Unplugged. Tibo was a bit henceforth as even though we didn’t get the funding from Annecy, he showed initiative and did not disappear. It was all a bit up in the air.

I even tried to introduce Darren and Jake to find synergies but both of them were kinda aloof and egoistic about it. It was a lack of self belief on Darren’s part as Chase Imagination had shut down by now and he was trying to find his footing again.

Had not given up on Phil Was There either, was trying to find a needle mover who could help get it made and found an interested party in one Mike Capon, executive producer at a multi purpose post production and branding facility. He looked accomplished and connected to the branding world to find a suitor for this project—> like Panasonic, already one of his clients. I pitched it as something they could have as a showcase for their 3d televisions which were a major selling point at that time.

Since, I was already working with Tibo on ‘Phil Was There’, he was the first choice for the meeting. Though, I wanted to miss no step and asked Darren to not just accompany us but lead the project. However, like I said Darren was going through something and completely misinterpreted my wording like I was doubting his experience, so I left him alone for the time being and took only Tibo to the meeting rather than going solo.

This is a email received from MIke in June 2011, sounds more than hopeful—>

![IMG_0451.jpeg](How%20Not%20to%20Start%20Up%20Prequel%20Part%202%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20a68a01760ded499c9d1989a2ba5370c1/IMG_0451.jpeg)

1st of June is also my parents anniversary, by the way. Remember being in a celebratory mood especially after that email. This was another reason I was concentrating more on making ‘You are a Xingji’ as other than it being a good script, if push comes to shove, wanted to make a strong case to direct ‘Phil Was There.’ As other than the money, it was preferred career progression at that time.

The thing with momentum is that either you have it or not, it does not come automatically. You gotta push. This mobile text received from him in March 2012 after a lot of pushing—>

Why were you not pitching it to other brands? Or at least discuss it with all involved if there was a serious effort? All an executive producer does is communicate and if you can not communicate properly than what makes you have that position? I have stack load of such emails that could be put into a museum of lousy thinking.

Let’s say Mike was being fed the fake narrative of my supposed inability to do rotos from rouge market elements, what do rotos have to do with an animated production? Nothing. 

At Rhythm and Hues technical directors used to be discouraged from doing rotos because it was considered a waste of time and there was a whole team doing only rotos—> its the norm at all mid to big studios doing film VFX. How was I doing sequencing supervising within a year if I was no good? But also in my spare time I was on top of their particle FX pipeline. Thats what I always thought while doing rotos, that my time was better utilised doing the actual thing. By that time, I was writing so much about deep issues in movie scripts, the most suitable job seemed like being on the Illuminati’s governing council. lol. It’s a joke, seriously 🤣

Moving on—>

In btw all this I visited Bar Kick where Tibo used to work and he told me about a short film script written by his friend Zack. Also that he was a bit unsure of even working in films at that time. Asked him to send it to me, he did—> told him that I will fund it as it would not be much expensive to make based on the settings but only If I get to direct, he can produce if he wants and if not than introduce me to Zack. Next thing I know he’s producing the film with Zack both writing and directing. I even asked him to have me as AD or something if not as a co producer but he didn’t even let me on the set but in fact started another company with Zack and Remy, another one of his friends, altogether completely zoning me out, while being his usual two faced self about it. He had even arranged a lunch meeting between Zack and Laura, knowing I had a thing for her.

Once while working together on a university project i checked my email on his computer but had to leave urgently and asked him to logout or he himself assured me that he will logout but didn’t. I knew he won’t and had to immediately change the password upon reaching home. Next day, he taunts me about his girl friend receiving monthly allowance from her father upon reading an email from my dad about sending expense money. He had been living in London a lot longer than me and asked him several times during that period to find me some job, any job, maybe even at his bar because sometimes I used to ask him for money during university days. He did kindly help sometimes, not always but never with a side job. I returned every time money was borrowed. There’s more about him later.

Back to the future—>

I had settled into the sleeping arrangement at Upton Park as the best scenario to save money while pursuing all these projects, keeping myself independent with a volatile job in hand. The details of the people i met there along with other things are reserved for the book. Jake and his partners were clearly not happy with me using their facility to make a poster for Miss Z. Even though it was our agreement to begin with and they had no real work other than like 10 random unrelated things to do during the day. Anyway, i stopped using their computers for doing my work after seeing the look on Mike’s face and bought my own laptop. But I made a mistake in buying a low end model to save money thinking I will upgrade once any of the project starts or with a different job as I was searching actively as our original faith based agreement had already been void because of their assholeness. There was no real contract for the job so I felt completely insecure in terms of the permanency of this job.

Just because 10 things can be done on a computer does not mean they all seamlessly transition from one to another. It takes different software and configuration to do different work let alone a shift in mindset altogether from doing 2d/ 3d conversion to making 3d lenticular poster to cutting trailer to making 3d holograms to graphic design to printing dvd covers to production manage shoots or some other crap while being the only one in the office without any clarity but listening to being blamed without merit and paid peanuts.

Getting a freelance gig through escape studios at MPC felt like a nice break even though it was only supposed to be only a 3 days contract as Nuke Compositor. Like explained, I had been doing all this 2d to 3d conversions and random experiments on Nuke, it made sense even though had mentioned my preference for Technical Director position on feature films to get a chance to properly orient and understand. By now I did not care about Prashant, having an inkling about him being toxic and probably giving wrong information to people based on couple of interactions.

Anyway, I was excited because this opportunity at MPC could have led to an upgrade in my situation. On the morning of the day I was supposed to start, got a phone call from my brother—> he needed some money, so, I first went to Western Union in Soho itself. Near Marble Arch, to be precise—> that was not the first or last time I would send him money.

I went into MPC with much expectation to turn things around but was again in a “what did I get myself situation?” There was a suite with 4 people, head compositor, a lady compositor, another compositor and myself. No orientation at all, they just wanted someone to come in, do the work as asked and leave, fair enough as they were paying good money but, I was not prepared. Had never done actual compositing on Nuke, therefore, first day i spent looking for guides and tutorials but could not connect to the internet. 

It was fine that they did not give the orientation but the head compositor could have given some introduction to their file system because it was not windows and not similar to the interface of Linux i had used at RnH. At the end of the day, had made some progress but could not save the files properly while the head compositor was busy this whole time chatting with the lady in the room. He was literally ignoring me or giving quick replies. He had to go to some party invited by the parents of his girl friend and kept talking about it till leaving early in the evening, leaving me alone with the lady compositor. It was not like this was an easy job either, had to sync about 3 to 4 different cameras and track smoke or strange shadows if I remember correctly. First, I asked the lady compositor for help, she gave me the dude’s email, i emailed him and the admin to find a solution for the issues but received no reply.

Next day, the head compositor tells me that I should have emailed him for any issues like the lady compositor did and looked really unhappy when I replied with facts. I worked that whole day but on the third day the producer pulled me aside even before I could get inside the suite and advised to leave because the team didn’t want me there. They did pay for all 3 days as I just checked the invoice. I saw that head compositor again at Pret A Manger in Soho while having a meeting with Darren, he saw me as well, I wanted to punch him but refrained 🤷🏾‍♂️

Back at Jake’s and feeling completely wrecked. Anyway, switched off everything else and concentrated on the job for a couple of weeks. I checked off some things from the list that made sense even though the confusion persisted as to the purpose, viability and rates.

Then was an invitation from Rikhil Bahadur for screening at University of Westminster theatre of the film we had worked on while in India as part of his post graduation—> there I met Pamela Weg, got her number and subsequently got infatuated. That introduction made reality slightly better at that time as Laura was in a relationship and I was not really a party goer. There was also Shuchi Singhal from Jaipur, Rajasthan—> like my AI bot with a mind of its own at this time 😅 on Gmail Chat. She was at the animation institute in a different batch and the first girl i got really infatuated to since adolescence after seeing her smoke at the stairs of the building like there’s no worry in the world! But never spoke to her during that time as she always seemed involved and there was no opportunity to talk. Also, i had been playing cricket with dudes till this point with no game at all as I had never been to an actual college either. Also because I left in btw and got a job but wanted to be with this girl and couldn’t have been where she was in Noida as I had already levelled up. I decided to bring her where I was but overlords at Rhythm and Hues ruined that plan by opening an office in Hyderabad and sending her there. I was not going to leave Mumbai at that time, lol. Because the goal was to make movies and RnH was only a pit stop, not a destination. Shuchi and I were speaking from this time onwards but there was definitely some gaps.

Once she dropped her phone in the toilets and told me on the chat, I bought her a new phone for GBP 60 approx from Peter’s card which Jake gave me knowing the exact purpose. In fact, he put the details in himself if I remember correctly because my debit card was not acceptable internationally and later deducted from my monthly wages. 

I was also sending money home every month, sometimes twice a month at this point so it be saved for the education loan or whatever. There was no guilt for spending some money on myself. That’s what friends do but she was very cagey about it as if it’s not a phone but an engagement ring 😭 and kept pestering me about it. Therefore, I had to tell her to pay the exact amount into Yadav ji’s welfare account—> he was a genuine person and a security guard at RnH who sadly died prematurely. There were other people who owed some money whom I had requested to deposit the balance in his welfare account Edited 19/12/2024–> and I got confirmation about their deposit, but nothing about her deposit.

Long story short as we will reserve the details for the book but one incident stands out—> i sent her flowers on Valentine’s Day in Feb 2009 through Argha Sen from Kolkata working at the same office in Hyderabad, people were really cagey about that, like its a crime to send flowers?! She got them, thanked me but then tells me she had been with some douche bag drinking till 4am that same night. Alright. Drinking with another person is not a problem, but why make it sound so shady right when I sent you the flowers?! There was no “oh I love you too or anything” but can you confirm my insecurities straight away?! Even though I introduced her to Kurt Kobain, had really low expectation from that point onwards. Edited 19/12/2924–> among many other things, she just didn’t seem like my kind of person.

Her behaviour made more sense when I got interested in psychology through reading + writing with better understanding of myself and other people. Later on learning about traumas through Dr. Nicole Lopera and thinking again by Dr. Adam Grant which is one aspect of the puzzle behind her communication.

Shuchi has great talent for illustration and animation so I tried to help her realise that in our last days, trying to motivate and even help promote it. At that time I was writing ‘Miss Z,’ ‘Pale Blue Dot,’ ‘You are a Xingji,’ ‘Civil War’ and ‘Phil Was There’ feature films which were all deep, conflicting and “controversial” topics but also vastly different from each other. You need to explore the void to dig that deep and output something entertaining. Therefore, I could not think of writing pre school content in parallel. You need to upgrade several levels to build any kind of separation between yourself and fictional content to not let it affect you emotionally—> requires lot of inner self discipline that a third person or even a reader can never appreciate. The projects never took off either though I hope she kept nurturing her creativity.

Every person has some beautiful story to tell, even if sometimes we can’t appreciate the content, there’s no way to deny the emotions. That’s what I look for in every stranger because thats the actual story and person underneath the facade.

Back flash—>

While we were trying to make ‘Phil Was There’ for the Olympics at Chase Imagination, I had received some quotes from Indian companies for the production. Met the bid producer from TATA ELXSI while he was in London but as previously explained the project went nowhere. Even after that I met their head honcho Mr. Natarajan in 2010 at the Mumbai office. Tried convincing him to fund it as an internal project as it could have opened up new market for them but never heard from him after that day—> stayed in couple of MTNL and BSNL guest houses in Colaba in South Bombay at that time, arranged by dad. 

There was another quote from Paprikas in Bengaluru and when I emailed their head honcho Mr. Nandish Domlur about the fate of the project, he replied with interest in working together even without the funding being secured—> I also visited their office in Bengaluru during the exile, again taking the 13 hour bus from Mumbai and stayed at a BSNL guest house arranged by my dad. Received a text from Mr. Domlur requesting to postpone the meeting to another time but I had no money to stay there without something real happening, therefore, insisted for the meeting. We met at his office, somehow talking about how Shekhar Kapoor thinks he’s the James Cameron of India and lofty goals of both lol…he probably knew my creative intentions even though I tried my best to convince him about doing everything within budget 🤷🏽‍♂️. 

Anyway, the same people who denied me the job previous year at DDU were giving tour of the facility and were visibly unhappy, I even gave them a correction in their 3d project about some Spider Man based theme park ride. WTF right?! 😀

Upon retuning from the tour I met the newly appointed MD, a Biren Ghosh who shook my hand and said “this is the only thing we give for free.” Mr. Domlur looked uncomfortable by Mr. Ghosh’s conduct as I had made it absolutely clear before the meeting of having no funds and left with a bad taste in my mouth. Came to know that during this time Mr. Domlur had sold his animation studio to Technicolor, a french conglomerate which had put Mr. Ghosh in charge. I had been connected with him on LinkedIn before this and he did not know anything abut the actual film business or animation in particular. Technicolor would also go on to buy MPC. 

I had no problem with Mr. Domlur and no hesitation in saying that he’s one of the most genuine people i have ever met without knowing all the behind the scene things. He’s into the craft of animation and not just the administration like Mr. Ghosh—> not even saying this because of his bad behaviour, but it’s true in general. 

Back to the future—>

I kept in touch with Nandish and he kindly gave me time while visiting London. I was late for the meeting because my new pants were loose and Jake purposely kept me late that evening. Even in that brief interaction, I learned from his conversation with another person at the meeting about simplicity in communication and how Mr. Mukesh Ambani was the bright one out of the two brothers, doing really well with his portion of Reliance Industries—> that ensued my interest in corporate governance and stocks.

Back from that meeting I had a fake warning waiting for me by Jake at creation film and television. They had been accessing my gmail all this while which I stupidly did not sign out of and they had even contacted people from it, including….lets keep the details for the book. They were extremely desperate and not happy that I was making moves, meeting investors and all—> these are the kind of people you call absolute leeches. Instead they were blaming me with all kinds of bullshit which did not make any sense because I did not even have a contract! They were barely paying me minimum wages and all of their software was unlicensed, in other words ‘Stolen.’ I had put a title of scientist, generalist and something else on LinkedIn because I was running all kinds of experiments for them and finally learning inside out of Nuke, which was again unlicensed. That was also part of the work to find unlicensed patches from the internet of the softwares in use. But let’s talk about morals, shall we?!

Jake and co. were my only proper contact in this place and only source of income even if I was getting screwed over by them. I had no other option than to fake apologise to keep the job for the time being as they also slashed my pay by GBP 250 due to this fake issue and officially + illegally paying below minimum wage without a contract. It’s not like I had put “Scientist at CERN” or “Bell Labs” or some other biology or chemistry or physics lab, anyone who could google Creation Films and TV could figure out what they were about and they were not even about that!

Yeah Science—>

CERN is part of this saga! Another person I met at Rikhil’s screening was a scientist from CERN who was also a film maker and looking for help—> told him about the experiments we were running at Creation Film and T. Thats right, did not pitch him my own business because I wanted to bring work to Jake and my other ventures were only the feature films written by myself! It had nothing to do with Jake and they were already in breach of our original contract where I was allowed to use his facility. There was no conflict of interest. It was not like I was taking Jake’s clients, in fact I was bringing them clients! After meeting Neil, the CERN scientist, I asked Jake about my commission for bringing clients and it was agreed at 10%. Even when on exile i was introducing Jake to anyone in London and looking for post production services like another University friend from Germany Fritz Polzer. I even introduced Luke to them for work experience but they didn’t like each other. They were looking for a first AD once so I even introduced Tibo Travers but they didn’t like him either.

Requested Jake to book the presentation room at Ogilvy, which he used for client presentations and I had been visiting to assist technically. Sure, once I dropped a hologram box and the glass broke, it was not diamond and these things happen everywhere. I did offered to pay for the glass, don’t remember if they took it or not. Knowing them, they probably did.

Anyway, the presentation suite was booked and Jake insisted to be present during the meeting to help. Neil came, I had not even started speaking yet when Jake took over and would not let me speak. But if I was not already feeling a bit betrayed, he started making substantial claims about working on ‘The Dark Knight’ and doing this and that for who and who…I was in utter disbelief because even though I knew he exaggerates things, this was next level of lies and kept looking at Neil for believing all the bullshit. Barely holding my laughter, but whatever. I was getting screwed so let him do his thing and let’s get that 10%. Morally wrong? Sure. From that point I knew that I was definitely dealing with a literal con man. Jake went to CERN sometime that year, I was excluded from all communication from this point onwards itself and never got any %, not even an introduction fee if we talk about intent and fairness. Neil also never thought of contacting me, so If i did not warn Neil, neither did Neil warned or included me when he could have asked Jake to include me in the conversation. 

Detour—>

This is a good spot to have a proper intro to Rikhil Bahadur. I first met him in 2006 at MAAC in South Ex while doing a diploma in Animation. It was a useful course as I got a job within a year of enrolling at Rhythm and Hues because of working my ass off and never completed it. Have you met a person who has seen a lot of Bollywood movies and think their life should be edited in that tone but suffer from worthlessness because obviously it’s not? Well, that pretty much him, even had a Yamaha Splendor and a general FOMO. Usually, the people trying to convince every one of their “coolness” are not that cool. I once mentioned the word “scaffolding” in a conversation at the institute and his reaction was “oh you are using big words.” lol. I didn’t even know how to react. We still got along for occasional conversations. I will write more about the institute and that time in the book.

Anyway, like already explained I helped him make his short film during the exile period by responding to a post on facebook, seeking a First AD. Don’t like to take too much credit but the script needed work when I got on board and pretty much everything including casting. I did not particularly liked the script even after some of my suggested edits were incorporated, they were pretty major edits and someone else would ask to be credited as script editor when the opening scene of the film starts with your dialogue? I was not getting paid, thats fine but conducted myself professionally while having some general non intrusive and non imposing fun. You need to build an atmosphere for people to gel even if they don’t understand the exact hijinks and call you names—> thats kinda beside the point. Rikhil carries “I am smarter than you persona”, hesitant to admit when he does not know something technical but tries to play it cool which comes across as fake—> don’t want to bust bubbles and the point is to uplift people so they can give their best. He also has good qualities like everyone, like being good at delegating and being ready for team work.

There were actors from the age of 10 to 50 on the set at various times and it’s difficult to manage school kids under deadlines with literally no prep with them but I don’t think anyone could complain. I was tired by the end of the last day shoot, stayed back the night and as others asked for a cab to go home in the morning. He seemed really pissed off about it. After the shoot, we were taking some general outtakes when an idea stuck to film the way back home with me holding the camera on the back of the bike while Rikhil was driving—> i had not used his camera to record video before, pressed the wrong button and discovered it only after arriving back in Noida. My bad. 

Back in London. He had already edited the film and wanted it graded. I did suggest another edit but the advice was discarded, fine. I offered to help again for free and got Jake’s blessings for using the office equipment for which they would be credited. It was an FCP project, thats mac native. We only had windows based machines other than a MacBook which was not around, besides the point as we had Rikhil’s MacBook. We had to export the EDL from FCP and access the footage from his hard drive which was also a mac drive to use with Avid for the grade. We pretty much solved all these problems but the footage was interlaced and no matter what we would try it would not de interlace. I even called Jake for help but his advice was not useful. I asked Rikhil to give me couple of days to figure out the issue and get back to him being aware of the screening date as the deadline. Next day or in a couple of days he posted about getting it edited by an experienced older gentleman. Great! But there was some unnecessary remark and a fake phone call made to make me feel lesser which again lol, idc about such idioticness. He’s a nobody anyway. As documented in part 1, we had a similar problem with a top colourist on Marty Unplugged, these things happen and its stupid to take it personally.

I contacted him re Neil from CERN after being fired from the job to get to know about Jake visiting their facility. I also introduced him to Inition to find some business. No resolution came out of that conversation.

Back to the future—>

In btw, this fake “breach of contract” issue and screwing me with a client there was another incident—> Jake had couple of interns from America in the office and they had taken over the DVD duties along with Mike. I was left with the rest of it and then came a test shoot. Initially, i was told to do nothing with it as they had another person brought in, a Sami Alani. But then I ended up production managing the whole thing along with Sami including arranging the cast and for 3 days non stop, with little or no sleep while still being made to do rest of the bullshit list so I don’t even have a minute of down time. Even accompanied the Director to get some background footage after getting the camera rigged on the window and did not forget to press the record button! lol. We got a lot of footage.

Jake and co. were extremely coy about giving me any title or credit because the whole attempt by now was to not let me build any credibility and for Jake to take all credit whether he’s doing the work or not. One incident stands out of all others—> The director asked for the latest script with a small edit but I didn’t have the script, so i asked Jake for the script, edited it once and sent but the director said it’s wrong. I checked and the edits were made as instructed so I asked Jake to check the script and send it to me again. It took him three attempts to send the latest script when I pointed out the exact issue and that he’s been sending me the wrong script all along! When he sent me the correct script, it was corrected and sent to the director who approved it immediately. Jake would not even admit to not having the funds to pay for certain things and try to spin the thing which made me look bad in front of others.

They were acting all strange throughout the shoot day while giving me dirty looks, I had not even eaten because of all this strangeness. They wanted me back in the office but I was the production manager on the call sheet! Hello! But the shoot had not even wrapped yet and they already started asking me to get back to the office for fixing some mistake. I felt like a slave at this point for taking the initiative to help with the shoot, making sure it went smoothly, not being paid anything extra but being forced to get back to the office after 72 hours of non stop work. Anyway, i got back to the office and looked at that stuff, it was not a “mistake,” emailed the guy at the other end explaining the same and Jake was something on the lines of “now you explained it to him, thats fine…sometimes these things happen.” All the focus was on my mistakes through the Hubble space telescope without looking at their own lack of process or thought put. I explained it to Peter along with being depressed because of al this and things were reorganised to make sure I was not being asked to do it all at the same time. 

Regular programming—>

That could have contributed to the fake “breach of contract issue.” Oh I am sorry have you looked at yourself ever?! Self reflection?! The evening day after of this incident Tibo and I had planned a fund raiser for ‘Phil Was There’ at his Bar Kick. Jake knew about it as he was invited. Nandish was also invited since he was still in London but passed. Had invited few of my other contacts including Pamela and Laura—> realised it could get funny. But luckily, Pamela showed a bit of apprehensiveness, I didn’t completely trusted her because she was introduced via Rikhil and it bothered me that he could have been privy to our private conversations. Wanted to address this with her but never got to that point as it took more than 3 emails to convince with everything else going on and wrote back a weird angry reply which was totally unnecessary and my fault completely.

Apologies were not going to get me out of that ever, knew right after sending that email. Yet, I sincerely apologised. Even tried to reconcile some part of the relationship by pushing the professional aspect of her helping with a script but it was not gonna work out. On that night, it almost solved a problem only if Laura had showed up, which she didn’t 🤣

The event in it self did not raise anything for Phil Was There, it ended up not even being about it but about Tibo and his friends! I was even more WTF! Felt out of place. Emma Stannard, lead actress of Marty Unplugged showed up and John Campbell, Costume Designer on both my short films, he was amazing! Freya was also there, wonderful person and makeup artist I had met on the VFX supervision movie. One of my investor contact that came was a man in his 80’s Bill Barclay, absolutely nothing to do with Barclay’s Bank 😅 —> he noticed the same things about the event being useless for the movie as I just described. I paid GBP 372 to Tibo within that week as my share of organising the event and decided to be careful about him. I am fine with attending parties but this was supposed to be a fundraising event! I could have spent that money to attend a better party in Shoreditch itself. Someone had fake booked the first floor of the bar for “20th Century Fox” that same night but no one ever showed up, I guess it was Jake or someone as foolish as him. Anyway.

Finally, Jake and co had a real project on their hands—> an advertisement for Anchor Butter with many cows in it for 2d to 3d conversion. I told them straight forward that this will be the only things I will do if they want to get it done properly while only working 10am to 530am with half n hour break in btw based on what they are paying me GBP 1000 only per month. If you know anything about pricing for such adverts then they were likely getting paid north of GBP 100000 at that time—> I competed it all alone, myself other than the rotos which I supervised helping correct the mistakes of others including of an old colleagues who was working remote freelance. There would be emails where I am asking Jake to “approve the shots” as a formality because he’s paying the money but his approval meant nothing.

Detour—> 

While working on this Anchor Butter project, suddenly I received a phone call from my father on creation film and television landline with Jake handing me the phone saying it’s your father. Maybe I had not spoken to them for only a day because so much was going on other than Jake’s project as detailed here. It felt strange to receive a call on the office landline! Dad said he looked up on the internet. Right. Okay, but are you trying to spy on me?! Why? I was always the more responsible one not only in immediate family but in the wider clan so unnecessary distrust out of insecurities makes me feel awkward. Also, you could never trust Jake for telling them some fake story. Anyway, interesting nugget.

Regular programming—>

The project was delivered within 2 months. I even handled the final pass to a grading studio in Soho on my own. All accepted and approved. Never met the actual client.

A week after that I was told to take a two week holiday which basically meant being fired from the permanent job after delivering their only and highly paid project, all on my own without any reward or incentive or severance. They did not even communicate the firing properly. I still had no other interview lined up and limited savings.

A sensible person or business with a long term view would have said here’s some bonus for completing this and let’s talk about future plans. Maybe, a proper contract with industry rates or a % in the company, lets start at 5%? But this person only knew to make money by cheap tricks. One day, around this time he gave a speech about working with him for 5 years “to make something of yourself” without any mention of a contract or proper rates being paid. Other than this work being a demotion and not building my career arc. I could have paid my education loan of that Anchor Butter project itself or the next project and why not?! 

I should “get rich” based on your convenience?! While also doing the work? On which planet is that the case?!

I was never a handy man and he was not interested in making movies like I did or involved me in the film business side of things because that would have revealed too much, also not going anywhere at that time.

Right after the fake “break of contract” email, overheard a conversation in the next room—>

Peter—> “Why are we employing an immigrant? My friend’s son just passed out of Uni…”

Jake—> “Because we will have to pay proper rates to a local.” 

I was an immigrant with proper work visa, by the way.

Independent Films—>

Tibo and the whole MA in producing has to be given credit for introduction to the core independent filmmaking and its business.

I had written first draft of ‘Miss Z’ feature film during this time in parallel while also writing ‘Phil was there’ feature film + transmedia plan. Hired an editor, Miss Charlie Whatley to help make it better as it was only my second feature film script and also first time working in such arrangement without things moving anywhere in terms of actual production—> She’s probably one of the most calm person I have ever met.

In a meeting with Tibo and Charlie at Soho Theatre, he was shouting for no reason like his usual self but also making some valid points. There was no follow up from his side after that meeting, this always is an indication of a person’s lack of dedication and interest.

Nothing happens on its own, you gotta make things happen—> I got the details of the Casting Director of the film Tibo was working as AD to put the cast together on paper as that’s the pathway to raising funds. Talk about spotting talent again and again—> one of my choices to play the leading role of Ms. Z was Miss Emilia Clarke but before she became famous for Games of Thrones. However, with no funds coming in, it was all going nowhere.

I was still pitching it to other producers and got a reply from Enrico Tessarin, well know within the independent film circles in London. They wanted to read the first 10 pages which I sent and they liked it! We started having conversation about the budget and other things. I met them at Soho Theatre, Tibo was in the loop—> his advise was to not engage further as “we will make it ourselves.” I foolishly did not reply to Enrico and Tibo again never followed up with me for months.

Started exploring Augmented Reality during this time as really needed a job and was getting no response from the VFX world. I was pretty adamant of not taking any Roto scoping jobs because as explained, it just does not fit into my mental model to be that lethargic. But while running out of money, I had to bite the bullet and accept a Rotoscoping contract for 1 day at BskyB—> it apparently went really well because they renewed it for 2 more days! But the supervisor was upset about me asking some technical question on the third day. I was already exhausted as well. Few months later, I saw that same guy again on the Tube, he didn’t look well.

Waiting for Mike Capon to start ‘Phil Was There.’ I had made up my mind of getting an agent to get me advertisements to Direct! Needed another short film to build a body of work. Had recently written one titled ‘You are a Xingji” which could be made for a low budget with some independent film cleverness. I started putting that together. Producing myself and had Tibo as First AD as he liked the script.

Jake called again during that time about a shoot in Lebanon! But they had to leave within a week while that was impossible on my Indian passport. He went to the shoot with Philip Linz, an intern from Germany who had been studying in London for few years. I was reinstated on the job with my original pay. During this time, he had hired one of Atyeb’s contact but I guess things didn’t work out and they wanted this project done well. It was clever and a douche bag move on his part to again take advantage of my cash flow situation to get another highly paid project done for little money.

They arrived back from the shoot though footage had not arrived with them yet. We had to vacate the basement office to another nearby location—> on the first floor of a graphic design agency called ‘Carter Wong Think’, designed the Formula 1 logo. Pretty cool.

I helped in the move, but there were some issues with the lease and was asked to be on call and to work from home. Had no idea what was going on and neither i was invested in finding out. But suddenly got a call from Jake to get this thing done urgently! The client was here and we had to get it all done in a couple of days because of a screening somewhere in the Middle East—> it was a music video of Najwa Karam, apparently the Madonna of that region and was produced by Sony. Alright. 

Detour—>

Also had an uncle and aunty visiting London as part of their world tour. It was good to see familiar faces and gestures, reminded me of mom and dad. They were kinda coy and didn’t take up any of my offers for dinner outside of their own hotel which was a bit weird. Image obsession is a general issue in the family and they apparently thought I was really struggling, which I was but not because of the reason they thought. Also, struggle never really bothered me as it probably bothered them. I could have taken them to dinner anywhere at that time so it’s their loss.

Regular Programming—>

Women rights and equal pay is an issue close to my heart as grew up around grandma’s strong character and a working mom. At the same time, I should also be paid same amount for the same work but especially If I am helping someone with the nooks and corners, maybe I should be paid more?! That was not the case during this production—> while I was getting paid only GBP 60 per day on the pretext of a “permanent job” while a freelancer Jake hired was being paid GBP 650 per day! I was helping her get around this tight production, even with the basic things while she jokingly called me a “criminal” for not extracting the alpha channel because of time limitations and non availability of rotos on few shots. I don’t think that’s fair at all and was already unhappy upon learning about the pay difference.

Still, being a professional I carried on with the work. Even took it home and had barely slept the first night. I don’t remember if she showed up next day or not but i ended up doing majority of it on my own. There was still something wrong with the lease as we were not allowed to stay beyond 6.30pm but project had to be delivered before the producer’s flight the next day in the afternoon. Therefore, Jake had all three of us move into a hotel room situated behind the office to finish this music video. But when it comes to Jake, nothing is that simple. 

It was pretty much myself completing the short with them watching and then Jake just left in the middle of the night without saying anything or any instructions or the money for expenses. No one can even make up this absolute douchebaggery. Not only did I finished the shots but the edit as well! Wow! Hailed a Black cab, took all the equipment including massive CPU because there was no time to transfer the footage to a hard drive with the client in toe with me helping in all this as we drove to a DI studios in Soho with severe time limitations. But got it done and delivered! Sent him packing to the Middle East! Apparently everyone at the screening was really happy with the 3d! At one point, it even looked like we won’t be able to pull it off but we did under severe pressure.

Was i rewarded with a bonus or increase in pay?! No. Nothing. Barely appreciated and Jake had no remorse at all of leaving in the middle of the night because he had to attend some weekend function as per my knowledge. 

It had not been a month yet, i had to wait for the pay before raising the issues and guess what Jake gave me to do in the meanwhile?—> some stupid rotos of Alice Cooper and band playing in an ice cave. My ass was not gonna fukin roto this shit. I shifted my focus on the short film production and asked Jake to produce it mainly by providing a red camera kit from his contacts which he kinda agreed but obviously I could not have trusted his word. Pay day came, I insisted upon payment and got it. Then asked for a raise, they said we are helping you with the short film production—> how about I won’t need your help if you pay me proper rates! Started crying about the Alice Cooper rotos not being proper and I was like fuck you asshole.

I was not going to work like a slave on peanuts even if I had to pick damn leaves for survival. At this point I had delivered two highly paid projects for these absolute assholes, mostly on my own but had nothing to show for it! No money and no one was giving me job based on these credits! Or maybe they were feeding incorrect ref in the market to discredit me for their own sake. It’s not even like I was just not getting what I deserved but, I was not even getting paid the normal local rates or permanent wages. Even if they thought I should be paid at a lower end because of my age which is ridiculous way of accessing anything, i was still being ripped off by a con man.

With no regular money, i had to eventually cancel the production for ‘You are a Xing ji’ and had already lost some money on recce and other expenses.

Detour—>

This is a good point to talk about another project that had been lingering at Creation Film and Television all this time—> Amphibious 3d. This was a feature film originally shot in 3d and we were supposed convert some shots from 2d to 3d to prove that conversion is better than shooting in 3D to the distributor Celsius Pictures, a french company. Also, one of the dozen producers on the film. It seemed like the whole market had footage of this film as I visited another facility levels above Jake’s and they had it playing on a 3d tele as well. Jake was always on Google trying to copy paste any information to impress re the current problems faced by the real VFX studio on that film but thats fine and not the point.

I once offered to cut the trailer for this film as there was much talk about it in the office, Jake kinda agreed as both of us didn’t like the original trailer. We also worked on it together little bit with him even advising to adjust couple of shots which I did. I was clear that this is the first time I am cutting a trailer but Jake had suggested to not say that to Thierry, owner of Celsius Pictures and to tell him that I have cut trailers before. The french man came in one day firing on all cylinders with ridiculing the trailer because it did not measure up to his sensibilities—> have you seen filmography of his company? It’s not too much to boost about. His main problem was missing text cards in between shots. It was a first pass, we could have put those in if he approved the cut. If you didn’t like the trailer, you can also ask to cut it the way you like or ask to make adjustments or add things? But to cut a trailer was not the purpose it seems? Afterwards, Jake didn’t say it’s a creative decision, these things happen but “you wasted all this time in cutting the trailer.” Okay?! Have you people ever actually made a film or anything creative at all?!

We had all these shots which were important but needed to be done when nothing else is happening without any budget and therefore, no rotos! Sure, there was a topless scene at the beginning of Amphibious 3d and I might have spent a little bit of extra time working on that but WTF it was hot and two lovers fighting a big sea monster! The film was filled with sexual references but I did not write it! Or produced it or anything else, I was only a 3d tester 🤣 for crying out loud. For the records, I never touched myself, forget about taking out my pants in their office or at any office ever. I remember, coming to work on a Sunday because of severe pressure to finish some shot of this film and had only started the machine, loaded Nuke with this shot when Mike came running down the basement stairs like he had regained his youth followed by a stare and an awkward silence.

At one point there was no 3d’s max either because the pirated version stopped working. We did not get it renewed till the interns came in and we used their university ID’s to get the student’s licence, lol! I was once asked to download all the seasons of ‘Coronation Street’ from torrents hub and put them on DVD for Jake’s wife! Okay! I had stopped watching anything on torrents myself a while back because we were working in the film industry and it felt ridiculous to watch pirated stuff. But, alright.

When I came back in 2012, Jake had created a new company as a technical facility to assist distribution companies with film deliverables and one of the films was Amphibious 3d. I was willingly running around the town to post films for festival screenings abroad if we were late for DHL or FedEx collection time and also to local companies because it was fun to get out. You get to see all these weird parts of the town. We once had to deliver Amphibious 3d and there were all kinds of funny tricks played with its footage, let’s just say it was not that multi dimensional in the end.

Regular programming—>

At this point I had dived pretty deep into Augmented Reality to recognise it as the future interface of computing. But still could not get any interviews, things were tight money wise. Therefore, had to sell the laptop that I had bought in December, last year. For about 1 month I did not have a laptop but only an old Nokia touch phone. Then I bought a cheap old IBM think pad for approx GBP 40 from the same shop.

Before selling the laptop, I had contacted family back home but they apparently were having problems of their own and was told things that felt like excuses.

I started writing more and more on my dairy while churning out drafts like a machine upon getting the IBM laptop. While also starting to connect with companies already working in Augmented Reality and drinking lots of Purdy’s Energy Drink…but money was running out.

Needed some project that was almost packaged so as to use some of the contacts I had made during all this time and get out of this mess—> decided to concentrate on ‘Bloody London.’ I didn’t even care about directing but to produce and getting paid was the motivation. Initiated conversation with various entities for funding though the project still needed some development as there was not even a proper script or compelling treatment. Let alone a cast or a finance plan.

Among other options were anybody I had helped who could help me during this time of need…Atyeb? During the exile I was still looking a job and almost had the offer letter via escape studios when they introduced me to the person in charge of 2d to 3d conversion at Prime Focus worldwide—> Martin Hobbs. It was supposed to be a permanent job to supervise rotos at their Mumbai facility but on London rates. They were impressed with my knowledge of 2d to 3d conversion. But I wanted to impress them more, sent the link for ‘Phil Was There’ hosted on Jonathan Klahr’s iCloud pages and also mentioned of being acquaintances with Phil captain 3d. I had shared by actual CV and nothing on it was that I had not been part of. There was a sudden 360 degree turn and all offers rescinded without any explanation or conversation. Spotted a back stabber now with two job offers I almost had but cancelled at the last moment.

Anyway, just because it did not work out for me doesn’t mean I won’t help anyone else. Atyeb was looking for a job at that time and I thought why not? So, i shared Martin’s email with him and he had been working at Prime Focus almost ever since. 

Back to the future.

I asked Atyeb to find me a job as anything at prime focus. No way I don’t fit in there after completing 2 projects mostly on my own other than acquiring deep knowledge about 3d because of the research done for ‘Phil Was There’ and prime focus doing so much 2d to 3d conversion at that time. Prime focus was not even on my list while working at RnH, so not being able to get into this studio was just absurd. He showed some interest, i even visited his home and his wife had kindly prepared dinner, he said that will help initially but never helped with the job and made some excuse.

I had one interview with a company called ‘Taylor James’ in Shoreditch and it went smooth but they didn’t take the application forward because they had high quality applications—> don’t know what that means? Did any of them delivered whole projects on their own including experience of working on Hollywood projects and wide technical knowledge? Anybody’s guess. 

Had been building up anxiety at this point due to severe stress as the back was against the wall again. I did ask for help from anyone I could, anyone who had shown any trust worthiness, but nothing. Cash flow was about to run out and I had to take up a job that will pay cash in hand rather than waiting for something that will pay at the end of month—> walked from Upton Park to Illford for 3 days to ask anyone who’d hire me and eventually a dude in pony tail looked like a hybrid of Remo Fernandez and Snoop Dog in a retail cloth showroom gave me an opportunity. I had to sell any one clothing article to the next person that enters the store. Tried my best, the person was a middle aged women, was able to make her laugh and even though she did not buy anything, apparently it was enough to get the job!

After a day at the Illford store, they transferred me to a store in Peckham for few weeks and then to Tooting Broadway for two weeks, then back to Peckham for next two months and then to Dagenham for a month. I don’t want to pose a sad picture, lol but it was peak winter and I was told to stand at the store front. It was almost like standing outdoors from 7am to 8pm with 15 minute lunch break—> both my hands caught septic with severe swelling because I never used to wear hand gloves before this as liked the hands to be free. But standing out in the front of the shop and walking long distance in extreme cold really exposed them to harms way, the cuts from the edges of container railing at the store led to the infection.

It was quite bad, i could not even use my fingers to hold the spoon to eat without severe pain which lasted for about a month but was healed due to an anti septic spray and helping hand in washing the utensils/ cooking by the house mates—> from initial 15 people, now it was only 8 people in 6 separate rooms. I had my own room for only £45 per week. Besides me, there were Deepak Suvarna + Aparna Shetty from Mumbai. We had our differences by the end of the stay, but they were really helpful during this period of 2 weeks. I remember washing the utensils for an extended period to cover up for the time they helped. Other people in the house were Perin Irani from Mumbai, Paul Madhupally from Tamil Nadu, Laya Sarah John from Kerela, mainly. There was also Shivani from Sri Lanka with her boy friend, but we didn’t interact much. Did not quit working during this time, it was not even an option.

Detour—>

Added 24th July 2024—> When Manish Bhai left, Deepak took the reins of running the house. There was not much to do as it was no longer a PG, and everyone had their own room. We had become fine friends, though i used to keep my work life private because not everyone needed to know everything. Deepak used to collect the rent on behalf of the landlord initially, we all used to give Deepak £5 pounds with the rent for common food items. It was nothing for an individual, but collectively enough. Never asked him about the usage or to give record. It went along like that for a while, then i noticed that he was buying some stuff for his own consumption, but adding the bill in the common budget. Heard him having a talk with his girl friend that “he would not know.” I inquired about the accounts, and there indeed was a discrepancy. It’s fine, he’s managing the thing, but he should not think that I don’t know. 

Therefore, I brought it up with him one evening during a conversation and he got really angry. I smiled back at him, that being my usual reaction in erroneous situation, and he got more angry, and aggressive. He shouted, and threatened to wipe that smile off my face. If you have never seen Deepak—> he is bulky, hard mass and taller. I stopped smiling, and told him to do what he wants, but don’t blame me for what happens afterwards—> I was going to call the police if he hit me. Common sense prevailed, I placated the situation as it was stupid to have a fight over chump change. This dude used to live right in the next room to me. Till that moment, i had only seen him fight in that tone with his girlfriend and once with one previous inhabitant of the house. I went with to his room, and again showed him the discrepancy. I also told him to not take that tone with me again, it was a warning.

We didn’t speak for months. We separated our flooding arrangement from that time, and even after that only spoke sparsely. Him and rest of his group didn’t used to include me in their activities and I didn’t used to talk to them about mine. Their behaviour was strange after that, like keeping the spies box in their room, among other cheap conduct. I was not going to buy all the spies, so I used to cook without the spices. lol. Sometimes, they would act like I am using some of their items, but I never did. Also, i never felt I owed these people any explanation either. 

I did go to few dinners with them before this incident, but that was it. They would feel bad or try to make me feel bad for not accompanying them on some weekend trips, and used to make their own assumptions. Like them being from India, and some racist stuff, hmmm I was myself from India and used to go for plenty of hike’s in mumbai. That was the issue of their own self esteem, and nothing to do with me. I just used to like spending my week and weekends writing or generating ideas, rather than joining them on a trip to an amusement park. Ideally, I would have liked to mingle with people with similar goals, but a dicey financial situation was always an issue. Should I spend £50 on rides and food with them or spend £10 sitting in a cafe honing my mind and skills?—> I chose the later. In fact, I never went to any amusement park with anyone else either, like I said, it’s an issue related to their own self esteem and nothing to do with me. Most people don’t know themselves or their emotions, and find it east to blame others. Last time, I went to an amusement park called ‘Fun n Fair’ in the 9th grade.

I used to enjoy my time conversing with them as a break or relief from all the high end stuff i used to otherwise think about for screenplays or tech. Their discourse was mostly based around  domestic issues or office gossip. One could only handle enough of that. 

Once Deepak and Aparna were shouting on the top of their voice in their room, right next to me for hours. They used to do this once every month at least, if not more often. That same evening I was accompanying Deepak to the laundry, and asked about the issue. There was no real issue, just rubbish, I told him to consider separating if they were going to keep fighting like that. That was to say that, why don’t you just learn to be calm?! Other than not wanting to be disturbed myself, I didn’t want them to hurt each other, and sometimes it seemed like they would do just that. I had never seen my parents or even neighbours fight like that amongst each other.

The company I mad made with Tibo, was registered through Deepak as he used to work for an office servicing company on part time basis on students visa. He earned some chump change commission for it. Just to say, i was happy to include them anywhere they fit. But these people had their own way of looking at things, and there was definitely lack of thoughtful alignment. They knew some people at Rhythm and Hues apparently, and gossip has wings, even if not true, especially if not true. 

I can write in more details about the whole stay in this house. Like when we bought a cake for a temp house mate’s birthday, but ate it all ourselves or when we tried to rent another house together from the shadiest property dealer. Laters.

Back to the future—>

Upon expiry of my Visa, I left the house without speaking to them. Room was left clean, everything in its place along with a telescope that I found in the basement storage. Didn’t want to carry a bunch of old clothes, dropped them in an old clothes sharing box nearby. I probably stayed 3 or 4 extra days without payment, after almost 2 years, thats just a given. I only met Perin on the last day in that house, and didn’t say much. 

Things were quite on Bloody London front even though I was pushing things. Darren brought a ‘Paul De Vos’ on board Bloody London and we were supposed to find synergies to get this made. There was another meeting with unhappy writers and another with a semi known director. Lots of meetings. No one was putting any money into it. I had written like 4 short horror scripts and had Charlie Whatley edit them but they didn’t want to use any of them! Paul had produced some low end horror movie and worked as assistant to some producer that he used to talk about endlessly but it was apparent his ideas about Bloody London were pure rubbish if not outright lousy.

Anyway, he used to live in or around Peckham and saw me working at this shop one Sunday, the next meeting they treated me like a termite and that was that. At this point, I was talking to Anil Ambani’s Reliance which was actively funding film projects among others without much back up or a packaged project. Bloody London is still where it was, pretty much.

I knew it was possible to get out of this hole and was still trying, still hustling anytime away from the shop floor. Imagination never turns off, never stops working. For someone else it might had been suffering, for me it was still an opportunity.

Detour—>

There was a lot to learn about direct sales and resilience, managing money among other things. I was still trying to build a team for projects and thats when I reconnected with another french man, Aurelien Simon. He was one of Tibo’s friend but there was some issue between them, didn’t care as Tibo was travelling in India and other places at this time with his friends. Had few meetings with Aurelien re ‘You are a Xingji’ everyone liked this script and also met his room mate from Poland during that time. They were all interesting people. We got Anthony Gurner on board as cinematographer, he was also a contact through Tibo and was a fine dude. I had been in touch with him and his girl friend Jenny, a production designer for months for different projects. Decided to use Aurelien’s apartment to shoot with him producing the short film but he backed out at the last minute. It was even the most clumsy and unprofessional excuses I had ever heard. Maybe, it’s a french thing, I don’t know. Still think it’s a great country with awesome people that I have still to meet.

The retail store owner was kinda impressed by my conduct even though we even had an argument because he didn’t want us to enjoy ourselves on the floor when there were no customers and started cursing on the phone. It led to a brief walk out and reconciliation. They made me supervisor of all the stores for a few days but everyone working there was really insecure about it including the guy who hired me as I had become even his boss—> told them I have no interest in this job altogether. They were like “he is still your guru.” lol. It didn’t last long and I quit in couple of week after that with enough money saved to last a month and a half. This job was only supposed to be a temporary arrangement to solve cash flow problem and was not going to lead me anywhere. More details in the book.

Question—> Have you ever been face to face with the real queen of England?

It was April end, start of May. Things were still the same in terms of real traction with the world but suddenly I had couple of interviews lined up while rapidly running out of cash. That’s when I received a text from Jake! Went to see him and I had the job again with original pay in biweekly payments. They had some small editing projects along with DVDs but not much else and I could feel the reluctance. As far as I was concerned, these people owned me money.

Anyways, I started work and was given some random shots to check If I could still do 2d to 3d conversion and of course could. I could do much more in Nuke at this point. 

I went to Oxford for one interview with a whole asset management pipeline design on paper to build them up from a single or two people studio to a whole some setup with my ultimate goal of being an animation facility making Pixar like content. But they had other ideas and looking for someone more “polished” within the service provider model.

I was back at Jake’s full time. Slowly and reluctantly, had been given all kinds of responsibilities from making presentations to editing a whole dvd box and transcoding various footage. I didn’t care as long as it was money at that point. This was still not good enough because the visa was going to expire in October and I had no money for extension or in general because these people were always on the edge of something.

Had been in touch with a producer at Mill London, a production company to help make ‘Phil Was There.’ He suggested to make it as a Live action movie which  stuck with me. Now I had little money saved from this job, it seemed better to invest in something I could show and maybe take a step further. That seemed like the only any to get ahead of the game.

Detour—>

My interest in Augmented Reality had been running wild as well and was looking for a team to build it. Usual problems—> no money, no equipment. The best option in town seemed like a company called ‘Inition’ based in Shoreditch! At this time, I used to get down from Tube at Bethnal Green and walk all around or take buses in Central London as that station was on the edge of Zone 2—> spending less money on the travel. 

Sometimes used to walk from Bank to Mile End and it was during one of these walks I had an encounter with London’s version of ‘Occupy Wall Street.’ There were massive camps and crowd all around this empty space—> happened to talk to few people there, one thing led to another and I was inside one of the camps having a debate. I was an immigrant being exploited without much of a job but compelled to tell them about persistence of hard work! They thought I was speaking for David Cameron and booed me off…lol, think he was doing fine but no way I was talking on his behalf. There was a cute girl vouching for me to keep speaking but no one listened to her and then she pretty much disappeared. I went there couple of more times but couldn’t find her.

Got in touch with Mr. Jim Grant, Co Founder who introduced me to their business development officer Mr. Don Eales, one of the more interesting people I had met because of various reasons but because the conversation eventually led to him asking me to rescue him from some island in Turkey by sending GBP 2100 in 2014. Little did he knew, I needed rescuing myself 🤣

Don introduced me to Stuart Cupit, CTO at Inition and the first meeting with him was awesome, it was going as prepared taking some cues from Don Draper of Mad Men himself but it was all screwed in the last 2 minutes where I went over board and Stuart said “You seem to be doing everything bigger than us.” Shit—> Jake’s influence had creeped upon me! That was a wake up call to be more conscious and myself but the starting point is never that easy.

I visited Inition’s office few times, things were not actually going anywhere though by this time was able to upgrade my knowledge to piece together a hypothesis—> no one was practically or actively working on the kind of Spatial Computing I was trying to build because of hard tech limitations till Magic Leap came into the limelight.

By that time Don told me that Inition was merging or selling the company during subsequent meetings which made me feel a catalyst for that sought of thing 😳. He also took me around Shoreditch introducing to people, some of whom I had already met. I knew from the onset that Don was a wild card and everyone knew that, he was like Jake x 100 with a hippie background. I kept trying to avoid him and get something done directly with Stuart but nothing was working out. Somewhat because of my own financial issues, I had been reduced to finding orders again with little authority from Inition rather than working on the tech or creative.

There was this talk about a new Sandwich shop in the Lancaster Gate neighbourhood and how their Indian food is absolutely amazing. Till then only viable option around that block was ‘Shiela’s Cafe’ right next to Mitre Pub, it was expensive for my “permanent salary” with little saving left after personal projects. I also fancied the Falafel shop near Paddington station, they made the best falafel sandwich ever. Also, I didn’t want to run into Peter who frequented to Mitre, maybe they would have found another excuse to pay me less based on my drinking capacity, who knew at this point?! Sheila’s used to be surround by Black Cab drivers which i liked, it gave the whole place a nice local vibe. That’s culture. I am not a big drinker but there’s capacity for some adventure from time to time. 

I paid a visit to this new sandwich shop which was built in the front of an old laundry. Like someone had made this whole things for a Dr. Who episode, totally Sci-fi. The small cafe was being run by Mr. Ashok Malik a divorced, lonely and struggling in his 60’s but always smiling and telling jokes, running this joint. The food was alright but most of the people were coming there for his smooth talk. We became kind of friends as I used to frequent to the cafe at lunch time while maintaining my usual non committal distance.

Knew there was no point in telling Jake about the short film because they were clearly and foolishly envious of my passion for making films. I started working on it after hours in parallel. Likely, they already knew because I was taking some location help from Philip Linz, ex intern. Had Anthony Gurner as Cinematographer and people I had been in touch with on other productions.

I used to be careful of not using Jake’s computer to access my email ever since the fake “breach of contract” incident. As you will notice below, most communication from 2011 in on gmail but 2012 emails are mainly on yahoo because I didn’t use yahoo for anything else at that time so it was fine to use in their office. 

But once I had no other choice with a meeting in the afternoon and internet not working on my phone. So. had to open my personal and business email using their Wi-Fi. Instantly knew something was wrong. Delved around later to find out my emails had been filtering through Carter Wong Think’s server and Jake had access to them. Obviously, I logged out, cleared out the cache and all.

Atyeb had stolen the client list from Prime Focus and was giving pointers to Jake among others. So, I had a draft email prepared if push comes to shove addressed to Martin and others at PF about this if I were to be treated like last time. Suddenly, after this latest email hacking incident, Atyeb called me saying he will find a job for me and why i was still working at Jake’s? He had been made aware of that draft.

I had always concentrated on myself and my work rather than bickering with idiots which is a weakness but also a strength. More in the book.

Carried on with the production of ‘Phil Was There.’ It’s quite a lot of work when you are doing everything on your own, not because there was no help but because help was at cost. Tried hiring a 1st AD but realised i didn’t need one and could save £200! Not only had I written it, I was producing without an AD, directing, casting, everything. Anthony was a good help for connecting with people but there was no one else on the production side. No assistants, nothing. I wanted to give some work to Mr. Malik as he was always crying about money so he became the caterer for the shoot!

Everyone on the crew was awesome to say the least. I had called Atyeb to bring his car to drop me off at the set to save cab money! He was surprised by the professional setup on set, thinking I was kidding around before that and left almost immediately. Had spent a lot already previous day on cabs while picking up a TV for set dressing from Convent Garden to Upton Park along with general snacks and consumables for the crew. There was not going to be any lapses in this production! All this was costing me the savings I had about GBP 2500 + Camera + Catering + personal expenses. More details in the book.

The camera provider insisted on keeping the Footage after the shoot unless I pay them full amount. I had the money to pay him but my card had a limit. He was Tibo and Anthony’s contact and they knew I was good so this behaviour really pissed me off. Especially, when he let Anthony have a back up copy. Anyway, i paid him within a few days and got the hard drive. I also paid everyone else and was waiting for Jake to pay me for anyone that was left including Mr Malik. Anthony said that the sandwiches were rotten and his stomach was bad for couple of days, i did not eat anything whole day other than come black coffee and could not comment. Did bring it up with Mr. Malik but he denied that being the case.

Jake had a new intern, this time from France. He was making a special effort to be friends with me, well, I am friends with everyone but with the usual distance. He kept pestering to know more and exchange ideas about Augmented Reality. Also, insisted on seeing the footage from the shoot as well and was really impressed. I was not surprised at all because it was as expected, real magic is editing after that. He had slowly started asking more questions as we were working on transcoding massive stock of film festival footage.

There was also a new polish hair saloon in the neighbourhood with an adjacent cafe called “At World’s End.” It was run by a family and in particular elder daughter Marta Filna, a philosophy major, deep green transparent eyes and short orangish/ brunette hair. We had couple of conversations, where I realised a real gap btw my thoughts and vocabulary.

I sent Jake email to use the office equipment to edit the short film because it didn’t seem right to use it without asking even though at that time I was allowed to take the laptop home and could have just used it. This is his reply and my response—>

![IMG_0445.jpeg](How%20Not%20to%20Start%20Up%20Prequel%20Part%202%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20a68a01760ded499c9d1989a2ba5370c1/IMG_0445.jpeg)

First of all, just read his email and tell me if that’s not written by a douche bag. Also, note that nothing has been mentioned about any “mistakes” but asking for all kinds of credits. I obviously want to clear this in written that he won’t claim rights over the whole IP or try to cop out of paying my wages.

Providing a laptop to edit does not mean that you are post producing the thing! I would have done all the work myself and only reason even asked to use his laptop was because I only had the IBM think pad which was good for nothing.

Then came the first Sunday after the shoot. I was cooling off at home and chatting with the house mates, trying to reconcile some differences when received an email from Jake in the evening, mind you i checked it it around 8pm—> 

![IMG_0446.jpeg](How%20Not%20to%20Start%20Up%20Prequel%20Part%202%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20a68a01760ded499c9d1989a2ba5370c1/IMG_0446.jpeg)

Instead of replying about not staking a claim on the IP for providing a laptop in a straight forward way, he’s now talking about all kinds of “mistakes.” If there were any mistakes it was mainly because of his bullshit. “The not write this down thing”—> By this time I had complete hang of Avid Media Composer among other things, he had been asking me to literally make a wiki of everything I knew about, so that he could keep hiring interns and make them do the work for free. Pay me actual rates, let alone what I deserved and I will write anything down you asshole, but not for peanuts. 

This is how an absolute manipulator sounds like. Also, what is this closing the office bit—> to gain sympathy to get me to do free work. There’s not been a bigger manipulator than this idiot. He still wants to “Help” with the film—> it’s to keep me in the office without being paid because I would be working on the short film. Also, to cover because he’s afraid his lies are going to be exposed. Here’s my reply and his response —>

![IMG_0447.jpeg](How%20Not%20to%20Start%20Up%20Prequel%20Part%202%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20a68a01760ded499c9d1989a2ba5370c1/IMG_0447.jpeg)

At this moment, I did not even want to work there anymore. But read his reply when manipulation did not work and my response—>

![IMG_0448.jpeg](How%20Not%20to%20Start%20Up%20Prequel%20Part%202%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20a68a01760ded499c9d1989a2ba5370c1/IMG_0448.jpeg)

This is what I was thinking but never sent after reading that email—> mother f**k*r sloppy British a**h*le, taking advantage of my skills for 2 years and exploiting me in every way possible then talking charity?! That’s what Britain is all about? No ideals, no fucking character just fucking leeches stealing stuff from all over the world crying about fake sophistication?! Is it a country of back stabbing thieves with no character and cheap ideals? F**k**g moron. I still had people to pay! British people!

I should have demanded 2 months and not only 2 years for all the harassment and exploitation based on lies, manipulation and intimidation.

Also, just read the change in his stance. Now the office does not need to be closed but “changed with immediate effect” What the fuck does that even mean?! Because he has found someone else to con?! For sure.

They weren’t expecting me to show up, but I got there first thing in the morning. First visited the cafe to find support if things went out of control, guess who was already there?! Jake! Office was not closed! Coward + a liar. Told him I will be waiting at the office and he arrived in no mood to talk like a man, no straight answers, started shouting, so I had to leave.

This was not supposed to be a blow by blow but you have already read Mike Capon’s email re the project. Jake himself tried to steal the IP in 2011 while I was still working for him by calling me to a nearby pub, not Mitre and telling a whole story without any paperwork about someone being interested but never mentioned payments or credits. I made him sign an NDA but he won’t email it! Because he’s a con man. He just wanted all the material and steal it—>

![IMG_0449.jpeg](How%20Not%20to%20Start%20Up%20Prequel%20Part%202%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20a68a01760ded499c9d1989a2ba5370c1/IMG_0449.jpeg)

Here is his reply, trying to avoid taking responsibility—>

![IMG_0450.jpeg](How%20Not%20to%20Start%20Up%20Prequel%20Part%202%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Fac%20a68a01760ded499c9d1989a2ba5370c1/IMG_0450.jpeg)

Note that I already attached all the material in the previous email with the NDA. But who says “I haven’t reviewed it yet?” Who says that when replying to the same email? You were asking me hand over all this to you without review? But never followed up to the same email?! s**mb*g like Jake. 

He never replied after that because his intention was only to steal, not to work together. Also, who does not want to “write stuff down” based on the above? 

I am writing stuff down since 1987–> that line is a joke, for idiots who don’t get humour.

There was tangible change in Jake’s behaviour after this email was sent, and that is also when the whole “mistakes being made” narrative became more of a focus in everything.

Continuing—>

Messaged the french intern and they sent him to have a word with me as their “spy.” Load of crap. Long story short, they agreed to pay for the previous week that I had worked and that’s it. I wanted to file a case against them to say the least but had no back up, visa about to expire in 3 months and most of the money was going to be spent on making outstanding payments. Only people left to pay after that were Anthony and Ash.

I would have not spoken to Jake after December 2010 itself if my financial situation was not bad. A person continuously doing wrong with you but taking no responsibility or accountability, also being shameless enough to have no self reflection. Thats why it was always problematic to even speak to him about anything as he was always lying about even small things. Somehow all habitual liars have a strong belief that more lies will get them out of a situation created because of their original lies—> just because I was silent did not mean I didn’t have a multi dimensional X-ray of his character and dealing like he was but maintaining own my character.

Had a date booked at The Mill for a free colour grade in couple of weeks, couldn’t have missed that offer knowing how hard it was to get Marty Unplugged graded. I only had IBM think pad which was only good for running Microsoft paintbrush, if even that. Atyeb had offered his laptop previously so i took him up on his offer, he tried to make an excuse but I insisted. Had to reinstall the operating system on it because there was something wrong and got much done before returning it in a week. You know what the work was? Compositing including rotos to replace a whole picture frame on the wall while the camera was not stable by design among many other things—> not only had my knowledge about Nuke’s UI had got better but this had a purpose other than harassment for being ambitious and awesome. Still have all the files.

Honestly, I was thinking, the market has to appreciate this much passion, initiative but most importantly repeated execution and performance?! The Mill itself could have been like “hey, this is nice, come work with us? Or at least what are you doing these days, let’s talk?” 

Tibo was being credited as Associate Producer so I requested him to pay Anthony GBP 100 as decided before the shoot—> later I did some VFX for one of Tibo’s short films which definitely settled the £100.00

Mr. Malik was visited at his cafe by a french person who gave him the order for supplying meals to security guards at London Olympics! I paid him off by working for him during that time after which he was paying me like 10 or sometimes 20 pounds for the whole days work. I kept helping him with bunch of stuff like legal paper work as he bought a bigger cafe, went all across the breath of the country to bring an industrial fridge back which I found on the internet for his new shop. Mr. Malik kept napping at the steering wheel in the middle of the motorway! Made it out alive by making him chew gums! lol.

In btw, I was working for Mr. John O’Toole, an Irish builder and friend of Mr. Malik. There was one mixup re a banner he wanted printed on insistence of Mr. Malik to get me paid. The mobile no on that printed banner was incorrect by one digit, pointed out by a visiting delivery man at the construction site. It was strange and unlike me. We came to the conclusion that neither of us proof read it and shared the blame. I still question that—>

My anxiety had really become worse at this point from two years of all this bullshit. I was still walking much of the distance everyday in the morning and by the time of reaching Edgeware road, would get a kind of seizure where my whole body used to get stiff and still like blood running really fast throughout a specific channel for a few seconds. Had to share it with someone but there was no one, been living on a prayer for a long time. Still had the issue even after coming to India and maybe living in extreme heat without an air conditioner fixed it?! Don’t know, maybe. But it did get fixed on its own! My anxiety got better to the point of not having that issue as my writing abilities started improving.

I kept working for Mr. O’Toole but one day he started shouting at me at Mr. Malik’s one bed room residence in Notting Hill with only two us there using his laptop. It was reminiscent of Walter White shouting at Jesse Pinkman in one of those episodes where Jesse having no other option had to drive the RV to Walter’s residence. Not nicely. I locked the apartment, asked him to shut up and explain himself. Gave him a phone call and he called Mr. Malik, lol. He was scared but i was not going to do anything. Kept yapping something the whole way. We walked up to Mr. Malik’s cafe and it was sorted with us parting ways. I received 75% of what was owed. Mr. Malik was very surprised that I agreed to his terms of arbitration, well I have always been reasonable but what can you do in unreasonable conditions sometimes? I was back working part time for Mr. Malik before leaving for India.

Extra Bits—>

Other than Soho, I used to hang around Convent Garden a lot because of all the cafe’s there, it was a good place to write. You could also walk around when tired. When Jake had let me go first time around and, i was running out of cash but hoping for one of the job applications to reply, writing was still important. Also, you need to change environment to avoid inertia. One of these days, an unknown black African man, dressed in ragged clothes, hair all dirty approached me and, asked for money. It was odd, had not happened before. I didn’t have much cash anyway. Then he asked, if I could take him to the Mile End Mosque as someone will help him there. I had never been to any Mosque, let alone one to the Mile End, that was out of question being a natural follower of Sanatan Dharma. He insisted that I help him with directions, it used to be on the way, so i knew the location. I ended up giving him whatever change was in my pocket, and showing him the bus number at the bus stop. Weird.

Another time, in Mayfair, this is after the second time Jake had let me go. I hired a new script editor as Charlie was busy or something. We had a meeting in a Starbucks. There was a middle eastern couple arguing about their marriage arrangements in a mix or Arabic and English on the table right next to ours. After the script editor left, the couple left and, I was about to leave—> checked my pocket for the Oyster travel card to find its been stolen. The cover was cut from the side, there was no card inside. My senses did notice few other things. Weird.

I was back working at Jake’s, third time around. Sometimes, I used to eat while sitting on the stairs of St. Paul Cathedral because it was a nice view, and environment. One day, a couple approached, saying they are from South Africa originally. We had a brief chat and, they invited me to a Christian function at the O2 on a Sunday. They even shared their mob number and messaged on Saturday evening, and called on Sunday morning. I had no plans to attend any religious function. Had to decline. Weird.

This was after last time when Jake screwed me over. Alexey had left London for Russia, but somehow he put me in touch with few people at the temple in Soho. They invited me to chat with them once a week, I thought let’s see and, they had food afterwards. I went for a couple of weeks, but then they changed location to som other apartment and, there was some strange judgement thing going on. Didn’t continue. Weird.

A caucasian women with brunette hair came to the Upton Park house, dressed in light blue dress, looked like a scout. She asked for the list of people that live in the house. She was strange, didn’t knew they were doing a survey. I asked for her credentials, but she left. Weird.

A Caucasian man, brown hair came to the Upton Park house and, wanted to check the garage. Only time I had been to the garage was with the lard lord when he was fixing his Black Cab in there. I offered to show him the garage, no problem. He showed some identity proof. But the door wasn’t opening so I asked him to try, he didn’t and just left. Weird.

At the Peckham retail shop, where I was working for a while, a man started frequenting, sold him couple of things. He came back one day a shoe that he had bought from the shop but it was like someone had beaten it with a hammer. He didn’t have a good reason and, don’t know what he was expecting?! Then he invited me to some reality show where he’s judge?! Shady as hell. Was he impressed with my sales skills and persona?! He wanted to know more. I told him this is a just a temp thing for cash flow, I used to work on movies and, adverts. He tells me “you shouldn’t have given up.” Okay. I didn’t, thats what temporary means. Never saw him again. Weird.

I was in touch with a company called Salt Co. They were film producers and distributors. It was tough times, anyway, got a meeting. They had read ‘Miss Z’ and, liked it. But their representative asks me “who are you to make this movie?” Aahm, the person who wrote the fuckin script?! What kind of question is that?! Everyone is not Spielberg at the beginning of their careers. Weirdos.

Appendix—>

Take this as a lesson in radical honesty. These are all facts and I am happy to be challenged about anything written on this page. Everything mentioned here is verifiable via document trail and emails. 

Events not mentioned here are being kept for the book which might not be exact recollection of reality.

Do I care anymore about any of this—> No. It’s more like stop saying lies about me and I will stop telling your truth.

Excuse the typos.
