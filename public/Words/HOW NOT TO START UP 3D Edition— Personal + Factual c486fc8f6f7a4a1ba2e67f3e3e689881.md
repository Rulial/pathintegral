In a previous post, I wrote about wanting to try something new around late 2014 to early 2015 because it was getting a bit boring. There was no interest in app development, and other work opportunities were taking time to materialise.

I started building VR headsets as a DIY project soon after the release of Oculus. This was right in the realm of my interest around VFX, AR and Holography at that time. Also, clear material was available to work upon as it was my first time building any sought of hardware from scratch. Sourcing different components starting from the cardboard VR boxes to more sophisticated ones was exciting as separate parts were not readily available.

Based on my hypothesis about AR as mentioned in a previous essay, now it was about building the tech. I had no experience on the hardware side, therefore, started concentrating on the software side. Which led me to research about volumetric projection in VR and eventually AR in my limited technical vocabulary but with code and practical demos the language part did not seem important at that time—> which I later realised is equally important.

Suchit Aggarwal, a cousin coming from a marketing background though on a hiatus from regular work was interested in indulging along though nothing was concrete about the roles. He bought an Oculus DK1 headset though we did not have a proper machine to plug in for development as specific GPU's were required. I could not understand his reluctance about investing in a machine since the initial investment, though small, was going waste. This showed a real lack of foresight, judgement and initiative on his part which made me less confident about the partnership already. There was no clear communication from him regarding the impasse and I had put an equal monetary investment by purchasing a 360 degree camera of similar price as the DK1 + more intellectual and sweat investment. Anyway, I ended up renting a machine as well and started developing small demos on my own as a side project. Additional context—> after paying for the rented machine for few months i did bring up this point with him and he paid 2 months rent.

I was continuously exchanging ideas back and forth, we attended couple of events during this time as well. My motivation was to get paid, therefore, like previous years was trying anything under my power. Rhythm and Hues had gone bankrupt the previous year, therefore, more approachable for business. I contacted Mandeep Singh, production manager previously but now running the operations at a new facility in Malaysia called Tau Films with the same people invested in the background. They were already doing something in the theme park/ virtual environment space and seemed interested in exploring ideas. Mandeep recommended that I write to Mr. John Hughes, founded Rhythm and Hues in 1987 and also founder of this new facility. Probably the longest email I ever wrote but did not get a reply. Whatever. We move on. Suchit realised that we needed investment to seriously build in this space, he pulled out a VC contact from somewhere and we had a meeting.

Edited August 2024—> Suchit seemed to understand what needed to be done, but was still too coy to take practical action, and I felt the need to lead. I was trying to push my volumetric research as the main idea. It was something we could build a solid and useful product around that was different from anything else in the market. We had no setup, like I said not even a proper machine. All these contradictions were reflective in the presentation and the meeting. The two middle aged VC guys from YourNest were napping during the presentation or acting to nap—> I don’t blame them, but still needed to wake them up! Last meeting I had in London was with an investor for my AR App ‘Your World’ and had already dealt with this kind of questions. 

Suchit was in touch with YourNest, who recommended that we pair up with an already existing business in Noida, working on some virtual reality solutions in industrial space. We had a meeting with this person, it was apparent he had some knowledge about general software engineering, but absolutely nothing about building in VR or AR. 

Added August 2024—> Included with the presentation to YourNest was also a video file of the screen recording to explain the basic concept of how I was going to build the volumetric VR system. As mentioned here, I had started putting the research together. Suchit loves getting into arguments about things he’s least informed or knowledgeable, because he thinks arrogance is “smart”, and this was another one of those occasions or I don’t know if he had an ulterior motive. At that time, he was not ready to form a company as a legal entity, we did not have any agreement, and basically told me to share the research after a conversation with this person without any documentation. I had no money and his whole conduct seemed dodgy/ nasty/ ridiculous. I had already shared the idea with him, with YourNest and with others, but I was not ready to share the research till pen was put on paper with assurance that we are going to work on this venture, that working with these guys meant there’s something in it for myself, and this was not just an idiotic information gathering exercise. 

Also, I was talking to other people who at that time seemed more equipped to help with this research, like Captain3d from Dreamworks, and John Hughes of Tau Films. I even shared it with Jake, after the fact, thinking he might act more ethically if I soothe his ego, even taking much of the blame to make mends and move on to better things—> better thing that I was presenting, but such people don’t think ethically or objectively. I learned this lesson the hard way, to never take blame for other people’s mistake, especially for habitual and corrosive liars like Jake. 

Some time later, Suchit made a company with a German guy to do something of his own. Then sometime later, he asked me to become director in this company with minimum shares, because the German guy was unavailable for attending the AGM and they needed to file taxes. I don’t know the exact purpose of this entity till this day or the background of the German who’s still one of the directors. My role is to sign the documents couple of times a year for compliance. That’s it. I don’t mind helping, but i have no interest in doing actual business with these people.

It has nothing to do with the director being from Germany. The first person I spoke about my augmented reality research back in 2011 was Fritz Phillip Linz, a German guy working at Jake’s. I applied to a German program for a research residency in 2008 while working at Rhythm and Hues. I had friends from Germany that I had introduced to Jake for post production services. Always found German people to be helpful, but also hold progress back by being restrictive and cagey, rather than being open and transparent. 

Detour—>

In btw, reluctantly attended a wedding and had a conversation with another cousin who never seemed too bright but was good at “studies.” I remember mentioning something on the lines of “there’s no point in holding onto the money, it needs to be invested in the market and economy.” That statement was not about taking anyone’s personal savings but on economic scale as a macro problem in India with lack of focus on RnD and technology sectors. My point was that with so much gold and massive personal wealth, how is the public infrastructure struggling in every aspect?! Its not about taking people’s gold but providing them viable OPTION to invest and make more money with their original savings relatively safe. That’s everywhere these days. This also benefits the wider society if we keep developing and building in earnest.

While growing up my parents were best friends with a Bhatia Uncle. His mother ‘Bhatia aunty’ used to lend money locally against gold and based on her savings in gold. Chit funds are everywhere as well. That means people of all economic background were and are interested in earning money but there were not enough clear market options for them to make money via investment that contribute to the economic system of the nation. Lesson no. 101 in Capitalism for the uneducated.

This was around India against corruption movement in Delhi, which led to the rise of Aam Admi Party and eventual election of Modi Ji of BJP as prime minister of India. As an inquisitive mind, these questions were naturally connected to the movement. I saw the look on this cousin’s face and realised he’s completely misconstruing my point but WTF, let him. Take this lesson—> It’s always good to correct idiots, always.

Privately, I was exploring more and more possibilities within VR by running experiments, it seemed like the right approach towards a MVP —> PMF. I won’t explain the whole tech behind AR and VR but it involved scanning of the immediate environment. Had learned about Lidar’s at Rhythm and Hues first time and seemed like an interesting tech to build interested experiments in VR. There was no investment coming from anywhere and still lacked basic equipment. Started looking for anyone who had access to scanning equipment. Found a person we had met at an event, had a meeting in Select City Walk, Saket, Delhi—> he recommended SIXD Marketing solutions in Noida along with a warning about them not being absolute professionals and run like a LALA company.

Suchit was pretty much aloof at this point, not showing any interest or making any efforts. He had not done anything useful till this point either. Added august 2024—> He had made a trip to Germany during this time. 

I met Akash Rana at SixD and rest of history. lol. It’s not but we hit a cord as he seemed like someone who wanted to learn though his limited technical understanding was apparent. He introduced me to their owner a Pawan Panchpal, he seemed technically more adapt than Akash but not at a level where I would be comfortable in exchanging ideas without over explanation. I did not have much expectations but we kept talking and you never know.

We started exploring product ideas within the VR realm. Introduced Suchit to them, we had another meeting. He didn’t seem comfortable with them, can’t blame him for that. But soon we all were trying to PUT a start up together which is counter intuitive because they are supposed to COME together as in people should know what they are bringing to the table from day 0—> the "co founders" from the 6th dimension were trying to comprehend their usefulness other than bringing the money which they did not have either.

The solution was for them to focus on sales and administration which did not mean I wouldn't be involved in sales but because they lacked a basic understanding of product development, it was important to not let them spoil it.

The whole thing was a bit way ward. So, i proposed working for them on whatever they wanted to develop or provide as service for a salary/ fee if they were not agreeable to the % distribution of the start up—> they agreed to everything because there were no intentions of making anything work and never respected their contractual obligations even after I kept attending meetings for them without getting paid and gave several demos which generated legitimate interest from the clients but never heard of a structured or serious follow up.

For about 3 months or something I had a falling out with Ash. Money was tight. One of Suchit’s contact ‘Shishir Bhanot’ was looking for a recording of himself singing in a music studio in Delhi. We were put in touch. I asked him what kind of video he’s looking for, and said he wanted a normal video with him and co-signer lip syncing. All details were agreed upon before hand. Advance was transferred via Paytm. He apparently did not know that multiple payments could be made. Okay.

Upon reaching the studio he says “I was gonna ask about your studies and all but it’s hectic.” Okay?! What?! Sounds like an idiot already. Anyway, on set both him and his co-signer seemed fine, in fact, friendly. The video was recorded as promised. The footage was constantly shown to this idiot while filming. He was wearing white T-shirt and co-signer black of their choice. He wanted Christmas lights in the background and brought some lights which were not usable. I spent more time shooting it than agreed. They kept doing something with the smoke machine on the day, and I was my usual self, helping, trying to make it better. Even on the day I shared ideas of making better music videos.

He had a massive pimple on his face on the day of the shoot. Kept asking if I could remove it. I did not remove it initially. He started manipulating for me to remove the pimple. I removed the pimple completely from his face, it was not even easy because of strange lighting. That in itself should have costed about Rs. 50,000.00 alone. It was all done for Rs 14000.00 I showed the video to about 10 people making YouTube videos for a living before sending it to him and everyone liked it for what it was. This dude started plain lying about everything which was trying to manipulate me in trying to shoot the video again in different settings based on my own ideas on that day. But without wanting to pay more. He’s my email to him—>

![IMG_0456.jpeg](HOW%20NOT%20TO%20START%20UP%203D%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Factual%20c486fc8f6f7a4a1ba2e67f3e3e689881/IMG_0456.jpeg)

Sent me some stupid video that didn’t hold a candle to the video I had shot and edited. I knew this person is an abysmal idiot and retuned half his money to save myself time. 

![IMG_0457.jpeg](HOW%20NOT%20TO%20START%20UP%203D%20Edition%E2%80%94%20Personal%20+%20Factual%20c486fc8f6f7a4a1ba2e67f3e3e689881/IMG_0457.jpeg)

About a year later, I saw a video he uploaded on Facebook. It was shot outdoor and still ridiculous. It’s about taste. He had no taste and being Suchit’s friend you can’t expect much else. Who knows what he had to do with it? 

29th Nov 2024

It escaped me before—> Shishir got a girl still in school and not older than 16 to 17 year as his duet partner to sing the song and the video. So, he’s a pedo apparently and was probably trying to impress the young girl?! I was cordial with both of them during the shoot, but you think about being courted by a fascist manipulator, gives me chills. It was not my place to intervene and I was not less aware about these issues at the time. 

A fact is I never added either of them on my socials as I stopped doing that from the time I used my personal Facebook as part of managing Rikhil’s Bahadur’s short film as mentioned in other essays.

Rajasthan is a gem of India, origin place of warriors like Maharana Pratap and many other greats, so it’s sad that I encountered a cheap person in Shishir, but there are all kinds of people everywhere.

We didn’t speak for a while as they didn’t respect the contract. Then I was called upon another meeting and introduced to Mr. Sandeep Garg, who turned to be lying in the neighbourhood of Sector 19 though where I grew up and still staying after my parent’s brief hiatus to sector 21. After the meeting, he dropped me home, we had a long conversation on the way where he was trying to scope me and was impressed to tell my mum at the door about me being extremely bright. lol. She already knew, i thought.

Didn’t contact Sandeep Ji again because it seemed inappropriate as he was introduced by SixD. Fairness is my game. Didn’t meet him till we met again at SixD for a project which idid not materialise. I don’t know why. No proper reason. Hey! These things happen. The conversations were running wild at this stage while exploring ideas about anything that could be done which seems appropriate when to come to know that Sandeep Ji has a website called [allthat.com](http://allthat.com) 

Nothing was off the radar from health care to statues to emerging tech to sugarcane juice! Of course they felt like I was invalidating most of their ideas. lol. I was helping them, seriously. It was like live comedy and someone else in my place would have taken advantage with these people eventually losing all money and probably fighting in court by now. It was pretty apparent they didn’t have much money or minds anyway, it became more and more clear as we went along.

At one point, the plan was to scan every known person in the world and gift them their own 3d printed bursts. lol. There was also a plan to make a digital museum of all these scans so that people can look at their own bursts in Virtual and Augmented reality. I am not exaggerating or making up any of this. Their big goal at that time was scanning Modi Ji and gifting him his own 3d printed statue. This was happening in 2015, so it’s not like the newly elected govt had done anything notable yet. 

They even scanned some celebrities including Mr. Kumar Vishwas but the output was bad. I didn’t even had anything to do with all this and never touched files either. If I had not already seen theatre of absurdness at Jake’s, this was some next level stuff in absurdness. As I would come to know, they were reselling 3d scanner till this point other than a failed attempt at a restaurant business and that is why named SixD ‘Marketing Solutions!’ At some point, I advised Akash to change it to ‘Engineering’ instead as there was more scope in that and they did!

Pawan wanted to make a multi camera scanner setup to scan celebrities because it was not working out with their usual retail scanners but backed out because when I shared the cost, it was obviously going to cost money! Duh! They had a scanner with a client that was apparently better and thats when were introduced to sculpture artist Mr. Naresh Kumawat. Pawan or Akash spoke to him on the phone and we all went to his Manesar workshop in the night. He seemed like a better business man than all those in the company, seemed connected and we kinda hit a mutual chord upon few small exchanges while going through the massive Lord Shiva sculpture in progress, out in the open. But he seemed to hit an even better chord with Mr. Sandeep or it seemed. I tried making a video from the inside of the statue with the 360 degree camera but it was not made for low light capture.

Naresh told us about the promotors plan to make a theme park inside the massive statue where they wanted virtual reality installations and rides and what not?! I was told to meet him at Raj Ghat because the promoter would be attending a function of a famous spiritual guru, I spent about 6 to 7 hours at the event, standing at the back all alone. He was nowhere to be seen until the end of the event when we got into his car and drove all the way to Manesar to meet the promoter but there was no one there either. His workshop was near the Maruti Suzuki plant and there was no viable transportation from there to the city at that time, but somehow I made it out of doh. I knew this person does not respects other people’s time and you can’t trust such a person.

I visited him again multiple times with Mr. Sandeep in tow, like always, other than the mutual project, Mr. Sandeep always had “all that” to discuss with everyone. For me, it was excruciating because I was doing 5 other things on the side. This all was time waste.

An appointment was fixed after a lot of pressure to visit the promotors office in Nathdwara, Rajasthan. Pawan and me went together, it was fine, they experienced all the demos, asked questions, were genuinely curious and nice to us. But not much could have been done because the statue was not even ready at this time. We tried to make a compelling argument to start as soon as possible because it was going to take time to build things but no proper estimate of costs was possible without firm plans. 

Next few months were spent us visiting or waiting for Naresh for several strange projects and listening to him talk about all his connections, the same kinda self promotion that every businessman does in India. But they all ended in disappointment. Not the kind of disappointment where we came short on something but kind of where a person was just toying with you for some weird reason. Apparently he didn’t like SixD, but even then why waste everyone else’s time?! 

Last time I visited his office in Manesar with Mr. Sandeep and he started fake/ indirectly cursing at me because of having no answer for wasting all this time and no real project to engage us! How can you make sculptures while having a shallow character?! Who knows?

We were back to my idea of starting a company to build the edutech project. I recalled Suchit to balance the scale as Pawan, Akash and Sandeep Ji seemed in tow. It was all decided, SixD was supposed to put the funds, Sandeep Ji was supposed to bring his contacts, while we were supposed to build the product. We didn’t want to be based within the same office as SixD and I had other things going on at the same time, therefore, travelling everyday to noida was not viable. 

We visited few coworking spaces and then zeroed on a place in Moolchand as it was convenient via metro, but they also had a place in Nehru Place. We were supposed to get the machines on rent and started interviewing people to build but the funds never came to pay the vendor. There was a lot of apprehensiveness. I don’t like that kind of indecisiveness and pulled the plug till at least the company was registered. 

At one point all the documents were also collected and there was one more "big meeting" at the co working space in Nehru Place that was supposed to launch this thing into the stratosphere. Everyone signed on to everything and then dud, nothing happened—> no company was registered. By this time everyone was getting used to this back paddling time and again.

SixD insisted on registering the company via their own chartered accountant who was constantly delaying matters and asking for documents that were not required to register a company in India like bank statements of all the proposed directors.

At this point there were 5 people supposed to be co-founders and directors in the company out of which 4 did not have any technical skills or even basic technical understanding about virtual reality or an original idea about the product. Also, none of them were putting any money in the company, other than having discussions of about this or that personal connection who could potentially bring the funds or clients.

SixD did buy a laptop at the beginning of our association upon my insistence as mentioned earlier—> I had to rent a CPU for development and demos without being paid by anyone. However, they only wanted to spend a specific amount therefore the laptop was not adept for VR dev or demos so I ended up renting the CPU again—> looked at it as an adjustment as I could use the laptop for general purpose work. Though, later used the laptop extensively for developing demo android and iPhone apps for AR inc for HoloLens + light untethered VR headsets. I also had to carry all of this several kilos of equipment around from place to place.

At the same time, I was also trying to form partnerships with the likes of HTC, Microsoft and others for the sake of making this thing work somehow with anything that was immediately available like the point cloud data of The Taj Mahal via the 6th dimension while putting things together for the actual Edu Tech product. I could see many other VR Startups getting funded based on shoddy PR activities and unbaked ideas during this phase which made no sense at all—> as a historical fact. Though, how can anyone else be blamed when 5 people couldn't even come to terms for registering a company 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

I had to pull back on everything realising the folly of constantly dealing with despots who could not stick to their word for a rupee, dollar or a dime.

Only basic expenses worth of monthly income while working on multiple projects, and the Suchit not wanting to spend any, we decided to do VR workshops and see if that could scale. When it came to workshops I wanted the participants to clear their fundamentals to enable thinking from a product development perspective because of all the material on "how to press the buttons to get a certain result in the software" is already available online in abundance. We did 2 workshops and it seemed like everyone enjoyed themselves—> don't remember why we didn’t conduct more of those.

By this time, SixD and Sandeep Ji had a falling out because of a project they got introduced for, in the first place. 

After sometime of detachment from Suchit and Sandeep Ji, SixD bought a Microsoft HoloLens. No one seemed to have a problem with me other than not being able to "tune" me to be their puppet. FYI, think the people from the 6th dimension still have our Oculus DK1! Additional context—> made the cousin whole by giving him the 360 degree camera which was a similar price as the Oculus.

After attending 100’s of meetings with Sandeep Ji, he introduced me to another Sandeep, they knew each other through a spiritual society. Mr. Arya was a genuine person but with a lala mindset when it came to running business. You can’t blame him if everyone was doing the same thing around here. They only worked on Government projects. It’s a whole different game which has nothing to do with the ground truth of either technology or people but making money and image. Still, Mr. Arya also thought I was trying to get rich quickly. lol. Well, I was only trying to get rich relative to my skills and abilities, if that meant getting rich quickly then 🤷🏽‍♂️

So, I did not burn any bridges and kept working with all the individuals in some capacity like attending meetings and giving demos which did not materialise into anything other than fascinating experiences. Still, none of them paid me anything for these services or was able to find any client.

No, i am not a victim in this as was aware of everything behind the scenes and made a massive mistake from the onset of not speaking my mind enough. Adjusting more than required and not leaving the room without hesitation. In part, because I always treated this venture as a side project to other things I was doing on my own.

Extra Bits—>

# I was tasked with building a VR installation at a Rajasthan Govt’s event in Jaipur, as part of trying to secure the project. Landed the evening before with so such instructions before hand. They had some talented in house talent who were doing their best, and already had another installation ready to showcase on Oculus. This was going to be on HTC Vive, and giving tour of one of the wonderful palaces. Pulled it off with limited time. Everyone seemed to like it, including the Chief Minister at that time. There was something about it printed in the news paper as well. Sandeep ji made a really bad, low ball comment about the Chief Minister in our private conversation which really bothered me, and made me think less of him. He even used to follow the same party! Sleazy. 

# Right after the above event. Sandeep ji offered to take me to meet his spiritual guru ji in Hathras, Uttar Pradesh. It’s part of the work, I thought. It was an informative and unique experience. Told me that the original guru Ji that the organisation worships were based across the border in Pakistan. They went on a secret mission to retrieve it to India, and it’s now based in Hathras. He wanted me commit making something for the organisation without any details. I meant all respect, but couldn’t commit to anything without exact details, in good conscience. SixD had committed something before on invitation, though couldn’t deliver because of budgetary issues, and I didn’t want to be in a similar situation. Mr. Arya is also member of this organisation.

# Presented at another event for Rajasthan Govt, this time in Kota. Went as expected—> a success. Let me add that The food was amazing in both the events. Mr. Arya came on the last day, I went to the Airport with him. We met couple of his friends. I stumbled a beer bottle by accident. Still drank the remaining. His friend gave me his business card when we were on our own. I gave the business card right back to Mr. Arya when we got in the cab, he told me to keep it. If I was looking to get “rich quickly” then there were many options.

Not being paid for any of this by the way. Only travel and 2 star hotel were booked directly by the office. This is because it was supposed to be a joint venture with Sandeep ji/myself on one side and Mr. Arya’s company being the other partner. But neither Sandeep ji or I had any money to invest or a setup to carry out the work. I brought this up many times, asking Mr. Arya to invest in a venture so that we could start building content. This could had been used for the govt. project as well. Otherwise, we would need to hire a facility or licence the content—> that wasn’t viable at all in the proposed budget. I even pulled myself out upon getting to know the initial budget, because it was impossible to deliver anything of value. But on a phone call Mr. Arya asked me to not leave him stranded, thats the only reason I continued.

We were supposed to build an high tech edu lab. Already, I didn’t like the project as it was being stuffed with toys to look good, rather than being useful to the students. Sandeep Ji, connected to one of his contacts building edtech content for YouTube, it was going to be useless other than the assets—> like all the other leads, this was also not transparent.

We also tried to convince the officials about this RFP not being useful for its core purpose, but they didn’t care. Helped them prepare it, fix it, correct basic details. Being cautious, I was looking for capable vendors to build the content, even tried to make a deal with SixD. At this point, as no one else did, i also stopped carrying about the quality. In the end, I decided to go in the tender presentation with a company based in Noida, already making VR content. They had signed an NDA. We had to discuss, and figure out all other details. Amtrak’s CEO Mr. Biswarup was part of all communication, and changed something in the NDA without notifying the other side, i did register my concern, but it was not anything major. I trusted him to take care of their business.

It was basic understanding that we were not going to present this other company. They sent someone along to the presentation, but this person was completely incompetent. It seemed they wanted to know the details rather than collaborate. None of their equipment worked during the Presentation either. 

I was extremely disappointed. But we had just come out of the presentation when they started throwing fake accusations. Couldn’t handle my reply. It was some Mr. Gupta speaking on behalf of the owners, absolutely idiotic person. This fella was working in USA before this, nothing worth mentioning. He writes back “I know how you people do business here in India.” I am sorry?! You violated the NDA, your equipment did not work. Your guy is lying now in the emails. You are talking rubbish. You did not read the NDA before signing, because of which it’s impossible for you to take any legal action. But alright?! He was trying to discredit me, thinking I work for Amtrak. lol. Didn’t know that I am my own boss. 

We did not get the tender. Tried inquiring with the officials who we had helped throughout the process, but got no proper answer. Really unprofessional. Don’t know what happened to the whole thing.

Being his usual self, Sandeep Ji was talking about 3 other things with Amtrak. I was never included in any of those other projects. Not that any of those projects made any money either. This type of lousy dealing also left us with no leverage. Sandeep ji would also keep looking for favours from all of these people.

# I never asked for and, was never paid any monies by any of these gentleman. 

# Sandeep ji started talking about a cleaning business, specializing in stone cleaning. I asked about his process, he said its his own formula. He wanted to have Mr. Arya as his partner to invest money in this. So, i had not made any money from any of this, now he’s starting a completely unrelated business with the same guy. I am not involved. Okay. I advised him to get a patent of the formula if it’s as good as he claims. None of the demonstrations that he gave me were out of the ordinary. I still helped him write to Mr. Arya asking for investment, advised on other matters on the condition that he hires my brother—> Rajat. He was good at sales, couldn’t find a proper job. But also similar to Sandeep ji in character. Thought, let’s connect them to take care of each other. He had been working since 2001 as far as I remember. Sleazy, but good at sales. We never spoke about the exact figure he was making. I told Sandeep ji to speak to him directly.

They mutually decided to work together, Mr Sandeep hired him for Rs. 60,000.00 per month. It seemed fair, you have to catch a break somewhere. Sandeep ji owed me. He was making 35K basic, and about 45k at the previous job with commissions as far as I knew. Also, just because someone is underpaying, does not mean thats the market rate. He was even interviewed by Mr. Arya, i was told. I was not involved financially in this. Just helping everyone.

Sandeep Ji started calling me every other day, complaining about him. That he’s talking about his girl friend with other people in the office. Other crap, non sensical complains. But he was getting orders, i asked?! “Yes, but it’s not right.” We met when I was back from Mumbai for a few days. Sandeep ji was complaining about his hygiene, not putting the water in the toilet from a bucket, and everything unrelated to the job. Get a flush or whatever asshole! He asks me “Should I tune him?” I was like do what you have to do, it’s between you, and him. I did advise my brother to take care of these small matters. Sandeep ji, kept asking Rajat to find him, and apparently everyone in the office some cheap Android TV’s from his previous job.

I was told he’s using kerosene to clean stones, it was not some formula. That’s why he couldn’t resell it in the market. It didn’t work out. Then Sandeep ji asks me to pay him the balance wages! Because he was short on money. Well, ask your business partner?! I gave Rajat Rs. 40,000.00 just to keep him calm. He never returned that money. That’s not the only money he owes me, by the way. When I asked him to pay back at leats 20K, he started shouting at me for no reason. Like I said, similar sleazy character. He’s quite low on self esteem, and thinks form that as his centre rather than being based in any virtue. I think he has potential like anyone else, and it’s never too late to become your best self, but you gotta make an earnest effort rathe than relying on sleaziness.

Sandeep ji, found his old employer, and previous salary, but basically he was after the TV’s. He sends me an email accusing of lying to him! This sleazeball, good for nothing idiot is accusing me! Sent him a reply right back, putting him in his place. I once lent him money, it was only Rs. 25000.00, for couple of days, but still, I never asked him for any monetary help. Now he was meow. He invited me to his office in Badarpur to settle this on a Sunday. I reached the office, he sent me a message saying he can’t make it, and still at his home! The same place I just came from, being neighbours. I had to shout at this idiot to get him there. Came after an hour. We decided firm terms to pay the balance to Rajat. He paid. End of matter. Haven’t spoken to him since.

Sandeep Ji’s biggest payday as per his own words was a large bag full of cash given to him by a liquor barren from Noida to install lights at a farmhouse apparently. You can’t make sensible workflows with that kind of experience, and mindset. That’s how he paid his daughter’s university fees in San Diego. Don’t know what it takes to convert all that cash into foreign exchange?! Should I mention this?! His Pakistani spiritual group might come after me?! Whatever. This is 🇮🇳 India.

# Didn’t continue with my research on volumetric rendering because a company called ‘Lightfield Labs” had a better overall approach. This is not similar to the current AI research.

# When it looked like I might have to share the research at some point, sent a copy of it to Laura Wilson in an encrypted pen drive, because I trusted her. Don’t think anyone could decrypt it, not easily. I also promised her 1% of the equity from my share as a gesture of goodwill. Informed her when it didn’t materialise. 

# Suchit and myself were in touch with Amneet Malhotra at Co Working. We first met at their newly constructed Nehru Place branch. She was trying to sell us the seats. Suchit said something, I made a joke about it, we all laughed. Though, we chose the Moolchand Space to start the proceedings as it was a separate room, and cheaper. I mentioned about finding Amneet interesting to Suchit, “do you want pointers.” He said. “No, she’s married and has a kid.” I replied. “She’s just an interesting character.” I added.

I liked her, it was no secret. We used to flirt, a bit. She did this thing with the hair once, and for a moment, I was like WOW beauty! She is extremely beautiful. But when she told me about being married to an Army officer, and having a kid. “oh shit” I said, and told her it being my bad luck, we both laughed it away. 

Never flirted with her again after that day. That coworking space did not have many takers. Don’t know if Suchit or her boss had something to do with it, though she used to try use my liking of her to keep us paying for the coworking space. lol. Nothing bad. I didn’t even add her on facebook when she asked, didn’t used to use it much. 

At another time, I had to change the company office address after Surbhi and Mithun’s departure, and booked the Patel Nagar space as it was more central, IDK. The plan I bought was to use this address as the registered address, but there was a technical difficulty because of which it was impossible to use their address for company registration. I had already paid for few months, but told them that they should known about this being useless to my cause, and various ways to resolve the matter. But Yatin, Amneet’s boss always acted like he’s above the client, couldn’t resolve anything. How come you are running a coworking space, and not aware about the issues in company registration? Had to use a different address. He was like Donald Trump of Co Working spaces, used to sell cofounder spots for investment in this coworking venture. I was told “Yatin invests in Startups” we had a meeting, where he was trying to sell me a cofounder spot, and you pretty much know what it’s about. I never got in touch with him ever again for any investments. He had a company called ‘Startup India’ completely separate from the govt of India initiative of the same name. I could not figure out what was that about either. Anyway, I know how to mind my business.

I even told this to Deeksha, the lawyer, and she was worried if I was talking in terms of the character—> no, i didn’t know about that aspect, but in terms of doing business. Made that explicitly clear to her.

If I am not using your plan for the required purpose then, why would I pay for it any further? Instead of refunding the money, they sent me an invoice after the billing period, no communication all this while, and claiming payment. Like, hell I am going to give you free money. lol. 

Amneet tried to convince me to pay, and use the Nehru Place space instead, but I was not interested. Told her extremely politely and respectfully, that it’s not happening. I used to frequently travel between Delhi and Mumbai by this time, it made more sense to use cafés, rather than commit to a coworking space. As an individual user, my assessment was that it’s better to pay for great coffee to use the space, rather than pay for the space, and get below average coffee for free.

I used to frequent the Starbucks at Nehru Place, it being on the same metro line as the house, and only 25 mins commute, much like Khan Market, a little further on the same metro line. Once, Amneet was sitting right in front of my table at that cafe, but I was busy. Didn’t disturb her either. I was not pursuing her at all.

I used to sometimes check her publicly available Instagram page, at the beginning because of intrigue as she never posted any photos of her husband. “So, maybe they are separated?” I thought. But no, that was not the case. Anyway, I was not going to get involved, any which way. Too complicated. 

#I was on touch with Dan O’Brien of HTC on behalf of this venture. He was the Pawan of Seattle, not really because Pawan sometimes followed through on his promises. But Dan promised us HTC VIVE headsets multiple times, but never delivered. Just stopped replying without providing a reason. In the meantime, they were supplying these headsets to various other well funded entities, who probably didn’t even need it. We needed it for only getting on with the project, but to also instil some relevance into the venture. 

If they had any valid concerned then they could have communicated after multiple conversations with their team. But nothing of that sought.

Appendix—>

1. Everything mentioned here is verifiable via documents trail and emails. 
2. Bank statements were not requested in a straight forward manner to evaluate the proposed partnership but as an excuse to register the company. I was anyway on board purely because of my skills therefore was not trying to “hide lack of balance” in my bank. If you are facilitating a loan or providing any financial service than of course it makes sense to check the bank statement of the client which was not the case.
3. Among other things I advised to change the name of their existing company to bring relevance to their current business which is not taking any credit away from the concerned for the work because of which they made progress but only stating a fact.
4. The concerned were getting benefited by showing their capabilities based on the demos but were not properly following up for this work though constantly pitching different business. I was not getting any revenue or salary from their other business. Therefore, I should have been paid as per the signed and agreed contract or they could have re-negotiated the contract, if there were any intentions of being fair—> by default negotiations stop after you sign the dotted line.
5. Not all skills are valued similarly or by the hour, niche’s are priced based on multitude of factors. That is why ‘negotiation’ is a brilliant tool to resolve any difference in interests.
6. It was proposed multiple times that if they want a product but not want to make a company then pay a lump sum amount to start the work but the concerned never followed up on those conversation either. 
7. Do I care anymore—> No.
8. Events not mentioned here are being kept for the book which might not be exact recollection of reality.
9. If you think any fact is not complete or have contesting information with real evidence, than its better to cross verify, rather than making a fake rumour or judgement. That goes for this whole series of essays.
10. All these events took place between 2014 and 2019.
11. Some details are added later, not because “I remember them later”, but I didn’t think those details were important in the first place. 

Excuse the typos.
