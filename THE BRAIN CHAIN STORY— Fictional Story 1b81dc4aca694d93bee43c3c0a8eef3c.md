Fictional City of Bombay

Please note: this is a piece of fiction with no resemblance to any person living or dead.

Magic money! Magic money! They said on the loud speaker as the truck was making its way down the street. Take magic money in exchange for your old belongings and never be broke again! Lalita, walking towards her regular cafe job, hears the announcement and is intrigued by a large crowd of seemingly wealthy people following the truck; usually her cynicism won't allow her to believe in something this dystopian but the struggle to make ends meet lately is real, which has her looking into things out of her comfort zone like lottery, chit funds and of course strip clubs. It can't hurt to know more, and there's time as she got out of the home early this evening to escape the small talk with her out of a job boyfriend, Zack Horsey.

The truck followed by cars, buses and a massive crowd of people makes its way into a carnival, glittering with bright lights and vividly painted surroundings. A giant wheel in the background spinning continuously without anyone riding in it. Lalita asks the people walking with her, is this for real? And what the fuck does it even mean? The only answer she gets is that it's Magic money! magic money! How could it not be real?! Who would even make up such a thing, right? Right?- Lalita "Yes, of course."

CITY CARNIVAL GROUNDS

The truck stops in the middle of the carnival grounds as the crowd that has followed it starts to settle around, there's a buzz, excitement and anticipation. This might be the thing that will change their lives forever; so finally they all can take that vacation to the place where the land meets the sea of red wine; the home of the dragon, where fishes grow on the trees, avocado is free; thou sins do not matter, and time is only a means of traveling from one place to another. A thousand dreams that abound at this gathering as a dude emerges out of the roof of the announcement truck with a mic in his hands, wearing a costume which can only describe the anomalies of Wall Street, Macho Man and Religious Zealots amalgamated together but not in any particular order. A pig face, a plaid white shirt under a golden suite, eyes have a permanent mask; palms of his hands are silvery and skin is all shinny bright. One look at him and you think if anyone can Magic Money, its this dude!

THE DUDE, LORD BRAINIAC

Lalita though, does not look that impressed by all this glitter; she has seen things in her life, been around the block and situations to believe in the hype, the presentation is interesting but she wants to hear the storytelling.

The dude takes a look around from his position up on the van, all these people waiting for him to speak, he's already feeling powerful, his thick golden skin does not give anything away, you can't tell if he's nervous, there are no scars or any sweat.

An echo out of the mic, startles the crowd as the dude in a comically thin voice calls on them- "Ladies and Gentleman." Lalita gets a chuckle out of this and is already feeling like its been worth her time, even if she gets nothing else out of it.

THE BRAINCHAIN SOCIETY

Before, proceeding any further, an interesting fact we missed about this world- there are no mobile phones or any other modern means of communication, not even wired phones or telegrams. That's because the ability to communicate telepathically is built into every human being, but that's not all! Everyone is born with an SHA 256 cryptographic, private key and public key to protect the telepathic data and privacy built into their souls operated by the brain nodes.

Anyway, back to the dude on the roof of the truck. "My name is Lord Brainiac" BEAT. "And I am here to introduce you all to MAGIC MONEY." A massive logo emerges from the same truck roof behind the dude and is almost as shinny as his suite.

"This amazing creation was invented by a god called Catoshi Pakamoto, he has since shifted to a different universe or disappeared, well…no one knows for sure and it's not important."

Lalita is losing interest and is about to stand up to leave when the dude continues "The important thing is that MAGIC MONEY can solve all of your money related problems, so basically all of your problems without seeing a therapist or doing the work because from now on all you would need for success is the proof of work."

This catches Lalita's interest as she steadies in her spot rather than getting up along with a few other people in the crowd.
