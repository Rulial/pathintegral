I had travelled to Nathdwara, and Ashwin joined me, travelling from Mumbai. Miraj Group had booked the air tickets, even back from Udaipur to Mumbai for both. They are legit, and not cheap.

We were to survey Shivji’s statue to submit our presentation to build an amusement park experience. But first, a company presentation at their corporate office. Ashwin didn’t include my profile in the presentation! That was totally not cool. Told him as such. The statue was near completion now, and quite impressive. This view of the sunset is from the top of the statue.

Felt they should develop the site as a meditation centre, like cosmic, and spiritual. Especially inside the statue. Didn’t seem like the kind of space where people should be running behind their kids on go karts while wearing VR goggles. But I have seen a common theme with these kind of projects wanting more flare rather than depth. It’s fine to have those activities outside the statue, in the surrounding park. Also, they needed to attract people from everywhere, only local crowd would not be enough for ROI. Shared my views, but there was plenty of time to figure all this out.

We came to Udaipur from Nathdwara, and had some famous food by the lake while I kept telling him about Anna.

Catch me if you can—>

My heart was broken. Didn’t want to be back at the hotel because everything about this place reminded me of Anna. Couldn’t go to Powai because everything there also reminded of her. Even tried few times, but it was unbearable. Tears. More wandering then ever.

Mr. Ramani had moved out of the hotel. Didn’t know about his where about, but the hotel gods made sure there was plenty of other entertainment. 

I wanted to travel to Russia to find Anna, but had no money. Like any other poet would do, I started writing about us, and thought maybe she’ll remember me seeing this movie someday. Therefore, I have to make a global cinematic masterpiece, so it gets exhibited in Russia 🥺. “Take your broken heart, and make art” Carrie Fisher, kinda thing. 

But there were other poets staying at the hotel. Well, they were con man 🤣, but also poets. They used to say poems from these amazing poets like Sahir Ludhianvi, among other. From Rekhta.com—>

> dekhā hai zindagī ko kuchh itne qarīb se
chehre tamām lagne lage haiñ ajiib se
> 

> English Translation —> I have seen life so up close, every face has started looking strange.
> 

After listening to such amazing poetry, I thought WTF? I am an astronaut! I will go get my love rather than just write a sad story about it. 

One of them named Rajan was posing as a retired army colonel. It didn’t make any sense from day one that an army colonel even retired would stay at this hotel. lol. If you are going to run a fucking game or a prank then at least have a viable story. But what he couldn’t accomplish due to lack intelligence, tried compensating with overconfidence 😆.

Hemant Vohra, had been stating at the hotel since last year. He was one of the guys, but also a little shady. He was the first one to tell me about this colonel staying at the hotel, and these splendid conversations around mid nights.

I had no incentive him calling him out, but these kind of people could also be dangerous because of their cowardice, and ego. One morning, they played a little sketch when Rajan pretended that his wallet was stolen at the airport because that’s where “he was stationed” in his new role after retirement. That story also didn’t make any sense. I offered some money to check his reaction. Just then, his collaborator pretended to lend him money in front of us at the cafe, old trick of confidence men. lol. They didn’t know about daddy yet. I had been studying con men for years at this point. lol. You are only fooling yourselves bitches.

Had alerted Chikee pretty early, and also tried alerting Gaurav even though we were not on talking terms. But he just wouldn’t listen to any reason which was odd. Maybe he was in on the thing? You never know. I was spending less and, less time at the cafe.

One night, we were sitting at the cafe till after hours as I had an early morning flight to catch. Rajan knew I am onto him, but kept pretending till I asked for his full name. Chikee was also there, he gave his full name with “what will you do?” Confidence. lol. I didn’t want to do anything. I googled the name he had given, and several articles started showing up of a man arrested for trying to get 1st class seats by posing as pilot of Lufthansa Airlines! 

[Fake Lufthansa pilot tries to board airplane | CNN](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/india-fake-lufthansa-pilot-arrest/index.html)

The photo even matched his face! Chikee was really scared when Rajan came back to the cafe, and gave us really weird looks. Lol. As I was leaving for the airport, Chikee gave me his father’s phone number if anything happened to him. lol. I never called him. WTF. You are in a hotel, he’s going to do nothing. 

Disney Hotstar Special—>

Organised another meeting with Manisha to discuss Metagame. This time Ashwin was going to tag along. 

Satyajit with Executive Producer’s credit arranged the invitations for the end of January. We got there on time, but it took half n hour for Ashwin to put his car in the parking. Anyway, there were also some issues with the security check. We made it somehow.

We were ready, and extra prepared knowing Manisha. She came in eating a pack of lays. Awesome. She was again trying to counter me at regular intervals with such lack of self awareness. Repeatedly embarrassing herself in front of other people in the room. She even got into an argument with Ashwin. lol. Satyajit couldn’t look us in the eyes. At one point she remarked “You keep saying CBI, but it’s no where in your beat sheet.” We showed it to her right there, mentioned at several places. She had not properly read the thing.

Then she made a comment which basically revealed the person behind her bias “You would have made this from some source material, this is nothing special, just putting things together.” Sid Jain. Living in a box, and thinking everyone operates like him. 

I am sorry?! ‘Master’s of the Sky’ did not use plot from “A feast of vultures.” It had nothing about character’s actual lives in the 1970’s or 80’s or 90’s. It was all made up based on relative timelines, and circumstances. Metagame was wholly original material as well.

Anyway, we were not there to be “proven right.” It was enough that Manisha somewhat realised the awkwardness of her behaviour. When we came out of the meeting Ashwin said “you were not making it up, what the hell was that?!” No, I was not making up anything. It was torture, mental abuse, and pure ridiculousness. Maybe, she had received fake feedback from bad references, and was doing her best to make sure I am legit?! Whatever. Let’s keep going, we thought. She also insisted on bringing a lead writer on board. Excuse me? I just wrote this whole thing on my own. Her argument was that I didn’t have relevant writing credits, and to let this project happen, so that “you can then make the next one as the lead writer.” Fair enough, I thought. Even though, I wanted to write/ direct the whole series. There are plenty of examples in Hollywood of “first time” directors getting that opportunity based on the material.

Manisha had asked us to submit a production document with desired cast, crew and budget. Basically, packaging the whole project.

We discussed, and realised that if they are abusing us right now, imagine what will happen later? Also, we did not have any money to bring lead writer. None of them was working on spec like myself. They all costed a fortune even if any one of them was even available. This was a specialised genre, thats the whole reason we landed it in the first place, because very few people could actual write a compelling story around this subject matter.

We tried to get in touch with some known writers, but realised pretty quickly the odds of securing anyone without having the funds. The other option was to bring an established production house onboard. We were already in touch with Roy Kapur Films for other projects, and Manisha used to work for Sidharth Roy Kapur at Disney before joining Hotstar—> It seemed like that best option as both Ashwin and myself were desperate to get paid. I had already put in so much work on spec.

We thought things could work out pretty well, and all pieces of the puzzle would fall in place. That was our biggest mistake. We never met Sidharth, but his team was kinda treating us like “these new kids on the block.” They couldn’t believe that we even pitched a project to Hotstar, and were in the process to green lit. The look on their face. Jignesh was trying to be helpful, trying to guide us, but we were looking for them to rather collaborate. Again, if people do what is required then things work out rather than doing “how they want things to be.”

In one meeting, they told us that if they take over the project than we would be reduced to “Creative consultants”, and they bulldoze pretty much everyone thats in their way. lol. “We would like to drive the bulldozer” I replied 🤣. Like I said, I could have had any of these jobs. Titles don’t impress me. Rest of their team was busy playing the usual “power games.” While Jignesh was still trying to mentor us away from the office, and told us that we have already done about 1-2 crore rupees/ $100,000 to $200,000 worth of work. I had done all the work till now. Let’s say attending 1 meeting, emotional support and proofreading is 2% of the work that Ashwin did—> not trying to take anything away from him, just facts. Yeah. Bells started ringing in our ears 🤑.

![01eebeec-8efb-4250-a9f7-4ee4db0d08a2.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Bollywood%20Edition%20Part%204%E2%80%94%20Perso%20f46e4f44e81e4364a20e082999414578/01eebeec-8efb-4250-a9f7-4ee4db0d08a2.jpeg)

Had our next meeting at this ☝️ place. This was nearby his residence in Juhu. Ashwin asked if I had any debt? I didn’t have any debt at that time. Seemed like he did. we decided to let the project happen, and take the money. We have so much other material, and I was constantly writing more stuff. I didn’t have any debt, but I wanted to get married to Anna, and was desperate because of this reason 🤷🏽‍♂️.

Next informal meeting with Jignesh was at Tata Starbucks, based at Red Chillies Entertainment. To my surprise, Sid Jain was sitting right there with someone. Not a coincidence. We could have contacted him before this, but I wanted to do this on my own, so there would be no question about my skills. As I had not discovered the benefits of writing essays, yet. lol. Thanks, Paul Graham.

Completely ignored Sid. He even kept looking at me while leaving. That was another big mistake. Jignesh came about 15 minutes after, and it was again a different vibe. Seemed like it’s botched. Maybe, we could have still contacted Sid, but for some reason we didn’t. Jignesh was saying that we should give credit to Manisha for taking this up, and bringing till this stage when I praised her for taking the risk already.

We were indeed the new kids in town about to make a big move without liquid capital, out of nowhere—> no one likes that apparently. We thought this all is getting too messy, let’s send them the next draft of the creative bible, and ask for the development money—> that we had already done. But Manisha replied in no time, trying to make it sound like it was us who were trying to push the project. When it was she who started it, and been equally interested in making. But didn’t want to pay up. She has been trying to manipulate the narrative to look good in the hood. Anything I would have said could have been attributed as “burning the bridges.” I already had an unnecessary reputation. So, I only replied “Thanks, Manisha.” Other than Disney Hotstar, i didn’t want to burn bridges with RKF, but probably should have gone after the money rather than being “sensible.”

Tried pitching a cricket based comedy drama titled ‘Big Stars Cricket Club’, something to follow-up after the IPL season for which they had the rights at that time. Nikhil was also a cricket fan. It could have been made in affordable budget, and we could have also made ‘Metagame’ right after that?! You gotta pace things properly. This made a lot of sense in terms of strategy. But they passed it almost immediately. Wonder, if it was even properly read. Probably not.

Disney Hotstar ended up making an absurdist sci-fi short series somewhat on similar themes with Anand Gandhi. Haven’t seen it, can’t comment. I had been in touch with this fella, and his team around 2014 when they were looking to collaborate with someone for VR projects, but they tried to hide incompetence when corrected about a technical detail, rather than admitting lack of knowledge. They asked for a physical meeting in Mumbai, I requested for a Skype conversation, but they never replied! Then always been in proximity. It was a weird interaction, and quite a coincidence of them getting to make this series. 

Manisha is not even credited for this show. Upon reading the reviews, Asimov is not the only one they took concepts from, it seems. NIkhil Madhok loves “telling stories” by stealing content, and making shitty series to amuse himself. “Head of original” more like head of thieves. What can you do about absolute idiots?! Whatever.

Facebook—>

I had been reading Anna’s posts on Instagram. She was being her usual self. Not trying to be vulnerable in reality, but in writing. My baby had a difficult childhood, and adult relationships. She was working on herself 😭.

I sent her a fiends request on Facebook, she accepted it, hurray. She would not message. Ego. I had to message her. She told me some bullshit like “I am was still angry, and we cannot have any communication.” Like WTF are you talking about baby?! Of course, kept trying to engage her with something or other while trying to give her importance. She responded as well. I guess we are both practical people. lol. 

But she was talking to Shakey as well. Which I thought was not cool while you have asked me to not communicate. How else will you feel secure?! Common. I thought. You are bringing me to the level of this idiot for no reason! I was not insecure, but really annoyed. Even channelled Annie’s energy to shout at him in the cafe. Well, I kinda shouted at Chikee when he asked if I would like to have a slice of cake, but it was for him. lol. Just weird.

She kept messaging on the same tangent, so I didn’t reply to one of her texts. She blocked me. That’s the first time someone had blocked me on Facebook as well, and second time overall she had blocked me. Well, I thought it’s definitely over unless through a miracle of god. Love is based in hope. I was even more curious about her.

Then my sweet baby made a long post on Instagram about being enough alone 🤷🏾‍♂️, and taking strength from “om mani padme hum.” Alright. Why can’t you take it easy sweetheart? I thought. 

Regular Programming—>

Rajan himself gave his full name to me, i did a simple google search for information about his arrest posing as a fake pilot, he must have been aware of this? Yet, idiotically enough, he kept playing the same fake character! I thought either this guy is absolutely crazy or seriously onto something. Didn’t want to interfere. He had not broken a specific law.

I kept listening to Rajan. There’s not a better way to understand anyone than to listen, even if they are lying. 

Gaurav went out with him to some Poets Gathering, and said everyone addressed him as colonel. Well, obviously it was a setup. He was upto a bunch of stuff with a lot of people at the pods.

In the meanwhile, we were working on a presentation for the Nathdwara Project. Ashwin was doing most of the work putting it together. Guess who got in touch?! Mr. Naresh Kumawat. He was coming to Mumbai, we arranged a meeting to discuss Nathdwara where he was staying at the Birla Guest house.

It’s one thing to know about wealth in terms of numbers, and altogether something else to see it. I had been around few billionaire’s by now, but to have a massive sea facing land in Mumbai—> i had been underestimating The Birla’s. Just a little detail. It was not going to affect my dealing. Wealth is impressive only as a mean to an end. Craft is more important.

The guest house itself needed renovation. He seemed to be looking for his cut of the proceedings. Shared the presentation from another company that was bidding for the project. It was filled with all kinds of flashy stuff like laser show, and what not. I told him about my vision based on which we wanted to present the project, he seemed to agree, but did not understand. Everyone is only interested in $$$. We actually cared about aligning the experience with the spiritual message of Om Namah Shivaya. 

But Naresh ji was still trying to control us, talking about all the other great work he was doing which we could be part of. Same old. Same old. Talking about 10 other projects that had nothing to do with us. Then he wanted us to travel to Pune, next day early morning to attend some tender briefing on his behalf. Ashwin agreed to it immediately. I couldn’t have said anything in that moment. 

We took him out for dinner to Phoenix Mall, he really loved their art installations. Ashwin paid that bill. I tipped. They exchanged numbers, I didn’t like that. We dropped him back at the guest house. 

On the way back, I asked Ashwin what exactly is our purpose in this statue building in Pune?! It had nothing to do with us! He had no answer. “We are not his errand boys” I said. Ashwin’s wife Natasha was also with us via phone. I explained to Ashwin exactly the way this guy does business. We are happy to give him his cut of the Nathdwara Project as introduction fee, but that’s it. Sure, I am scared of him botching the whole project, but I also don’t want to work with him if that’s his mindset.

We communicated the same to Naresh ji right then. He insisted that we go to Pune. “Sorry, we have work”, and we actually had other important things to work on rather than being his errand boys. I was happy to collaborate on something valid, but this project had nothing to do with us at all! He insisted that we help him print the presentation on in colour on paper for it to be couriered. There were at least 2 helpers in the guest house, he could have sent anyone. But anyway, we found a printer, and photocopy shop close by to his place on google maps, I paid him, and had it delivered. He wanted something changed. Alright! We got it done. It was unnecessary demands. Didn’t speak to him again about this. I think he’s a fine sculpture, but there are better ways to engage in business.

Mehta Ji from Miraj group was visiting Mumbai for some other project, I was trying to fix a meeting with him to pitch our idea about the Nathdwara Project. But also, they were doing other things in films and television…and thought we could collaborate on more than one thing. At the same time, I didn’t want to start everything at the same time, and also Mr. Mehta was from construction and infrastructure department. So, we needed to be introduced to other people.

There was a person staying at the pod hotel from Miraj group. I didn’t want to speak to him being already in touch with Mr. Mehta. But maybe they purposely had this person staying at the hotel? Background check? I don’t know. I was moving, and texting with both Ashwin and Mr. Mehta at the same time to fix this meeting when one text for Ashwin, went to Mr. Mehta.

I just didn’t add Ji or Mr along with his name in that message, also mentioned confusion about someone staying at the hotel from their organisation with brevity in texts as you do with friends. Noticed it as soon as pressed sent, and apologised to Mehta ji. Took him out for lunch at Balaji Restaurant at the Domestic Airport, got to know him a little better. It all seemed fine.

Catch me if you can—>

Had not been to Inorbit Mall with Anna, which seemed like a place to get some work done, but I was too overwhelmed. Still, the show much go on! On one of these days, I had to take shit, opened the door of the toilets, somehow it bounced off my own foot while I kept walking forward, resulting in my head hitting its edge, and opening an actual crack on my forehead.

Netflix India passed on everything we would share saying it’s too exotic. We had been pretty much rejected from every other place within that 2 months time. Wonder what was going on from everyone being interested to suddenly, we couldn’t even find a dog to wag his tail. Small town, big egos? Bad worth of mouth? I realised people don’t so much care about the material, but their ability to have control over you.

At the same time, Rajan was showing a lot of interest in me specially. He would keep asking about me at the pods. I was not scared. lol. Even when he used to say stuff like “I can off a person in 8 seconds” 😭. Asked him one day to show his moves, it was the most naive set of moves I had ever seen—> he slowly lifted me up by the shoulders, and said he could do something. Well, a skilled practitioner would have whooped his ass within those 8 seconds, and even washed hands in btw. But I told him he’s most incredible 😂. 

Athar Ali Nagpurwalla was again at the pods, I just loved introducing people who were unlikeliest to meet otherwise, and therefore, had them meet. Felt like they had a prior connection? Not sure. But they hit it off immediately, both in awe of each other, or at least Athar was, and Rajan was making up stuff on the go. I did warn him explicitly—> “I have nothing to do with either, now or in the future. If you happen to do anything together, it has nothing to do with me, and I had no responsibility.” It was just so much fun seeing them interact, couldn’t even hold my laughter, and that in itself was a warning.

Right on the next evening, Rajan brought a walkie talkie with him to the hotel saying he’s coordinating some VVIP travel. I think he said Donald Trump even though Trump was not visiting Mumbai. It was a toy walkie talkie, like the most toyish walkie talkie ever. According to him, he was on a break from duties at the airport, and….. had to visit us at the hotel?! 🤣🤣. He even went to Tunga restaurant with us for dinner, and said on the walkie talkie to not disturb him for 1 hours. 😂 lol. I don’t know what this guy was on.

One evening I was really onto him. Asked if he would like to do corporate espionage? He looked really interested, and taking it seriously like he had finally reached the next level. I just thought it would be really fun to see him in a meeting with Manisha 🤣🤣🤣. Like, how come you are claiming to be colonel with all these responsibilities, and a walkie talkie 😂 and still interested in doing shady stuff bro?! Someone disturbed us when I was about to crack him open, think it was Gaurav or one of his con man partners.

Another evening he brought a young north eastern girl to the pods, saying she’s daughter of his friend visiting for some interview, and he had to take care of her. They went to the pods together. Shakey came to the front desk to complain around mid night about Rajan in the pod below him “making a lot of noise.” You can read between the lines, i guess. The duty manager at the front desk, also an actor told me this girl with Rajan works as an extra/ background actor in Bollywood. Why did he need to make the whole story?! I don’t know, I don’t know! 

I was concentrating on the independent feature film, trying to put it together, though with little interest from Ashwin. An absurdist sci-fi comedy based around cab journey among other things, but good. I was sharing it with a lot of people around the town to find some help. Already had a DOP Abhira on board, had been in touch with him since trying to put together ‘The Great Indian Rope Trick’, and every time the projects kept falling out. Also in touch with some actors including a role for Sanjay.

Also started talking to a film producer friend in Russia, he did set photography on ‘Phil Was There’, and was making an independent film of his own. He was also working with some film school in Serbia. It would be good to get paid to visit, i thought. This would have also made it easier to find Anna ❣️

One night Gaurav brought up the issue of Rajan’s news clippings in front of him, and Rajan said it’s a look alike who stole his wallet, and has been caught multiple times 🤣. Chikee and myself knew he was lying, but Gaurav was convinced now that it’s the truth 😂. 

When the thing with Hotstar didn’t workout, I was really motivated to get something green lit, we contacted Netflix India again to pitch them a story i wrote for Metagame, but as a completely different series. Once you properly build a world, there are a lot of stories that can come out of it. But I had to send him beat sheets for like 5 episodes along with treatment for 8 episodes or something by the next day. It was past mid night, I was working non stop, Chikee was just sitting there, not disturbing, but this wired idiot who’s some casting director also staying at the hotel came in drunk, and started shouting all kinds of vulgarities at me! I don’t even know this person! Never spoke to him! At first, couldn’t even believe he’s shouting at me 🤣! I was just too determined to get the work done, and send it. Time was of the essence, Annie was so far away, and alone ☹️. Chikee said he will go inside, and come back, but never came back 😆. 

This dude kept shouting and cursing for 3 hours at least, if not more, at one point I even got up, and asked the hotel front desk to turn off the cameras. I just wanted him to shut up! He felt threatened, and said that he will call people 🤣, but they will come in the morning or something 😭. I don’t know whats wrong with these people. Went back to doing my work. Kept working till 8am. Had a chat with this idiot as soon as the work finished, shook his hand, made him realise this stupidity, and waste of energy. We had a long chat about values, and family, he was apologetic by the end of it. Fine. We all make mistakes. As you were.

Netflix India came back pretty quickly, and passed on this as well. It felt like a formality. Saying its not something that fits into their programming. Hmm what exactly fits into your programming was my only question at this point? Anyway. Whatever. Went back to working on ‘The Moon Project.’

Had a brunch with Vineet Walimbe, some 🍻 at the Pali Hill Cafe in Bandra. Told him about my plans of going to Russia to find Anna. 

My health was taking a toll with not much sleep or relaxation, and all this going on. Was not feeling too good upon returning to the hotel from the brunch. Sachin, the independent filmmaker from Shimla came up to me in secrecy, saying he needs to tell me something about Rajan 🤣. “I know!” But he told me that Rajan has taken money from a bunch of people at the pods including Athar, and Gaurav to get them membership of The Soho House 🤣. What?! lol. I mean, all they had to do was a quick google search on his name, and Gaurav already knew everything! WTF! 

Athar called me saying he’s with Gaurav at Hotel Lila’s, and we should join them to discuss this matter. A crime mystery! I had to take a Dolo paracetamol because of the fever, but was not going to miss so much fun 😂! 

We just couldn’t stop laughing sharing all the stories about Rajan, it was a wild night. Like some crime comedy by Priyadarshan, but happening realtime. Athar said that he even spoke to a police commissioner about Rajan. They were worried about Rajan retaliating, and wanting to file a report to the police. Lila was too expensive. We moved to Tata Starbucks at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Airport in an auto, all 4 of us, it was definitely a Priyadarshan’s comedy at this point. 

At TATA Starbucks, we were still discussing the strategy to get Rajan caught, but we were not sure. When Sachin asked what would Rajan be thinking at this point? Gaurav made the best joke/ comment of his life “he would be thinking, they are still not sure.” 🤣🤣🤣. We were in splits. Laughing out loud on the floor of the cafe. There were plans discussed to beat up Rajan in his pod 🤣. In the end, it was decided to not do anything, but inform the hotel. The hotel said that they have no problem with Rajan lying about his identity. lol. Of course, they didn’t. It was just too much fun. 

I didn’t really trust any one of them at the pods, for all I knew, it could all have been an inside job or whatever. One night, Rajan came to talk to us in the cafe—> again rubbish trying to impress upon for some reason, and at the same time scare with his usual could do this or that in 8 seconds. But then he showed a photo on his phone of himself receiving an award from President Pratibha Patil along with a whole story. Knew it was a fake/ doctored photo, but badly done, the moment he showed it. As soon as he left, googled similar photos, and found the exact original photo that Rajan had doctored, and showed it to Gaurav and Sachin. This all was getting too much now.

My health had gotten worse day by day with high fever. At the same time news of Covid 19 started showing up everywhere. Definitely scared upon reading about a nearby hospital having cases of corona virus. But I was also running out of money as my money management during this time went Hail Mary. Spending more in fancy restaurants than usual due to the fear of getting into depression with a broken heart ❤️‍🩹. The salary was going to come at the end of the month, but had already spent the bank balance. Ash was more, and more nasty during this time for some reason. I asked my brother to send Rs. 2500 for expenses, first time I had asked him for money, he had to take permission from his wife. Like seriously, I thought? lol. Anyway, that money was returned to him as soon as I got paid at the end of the month.

Some countries had already declared a lockdown, and it seemed imminent that India was also going to close sooner than later. I was sitting in the hotel cafe with a face mask on, thinking this would be the end of me apparently. But also of everything else?! Can I speak to Anna before this final sunset? Over dramatic. 

Rajan was showing much concern for my health during this time, and said that I should speak to his doctor friend. He even arranged a call. lol. Like I was going to take whatever he was suggesting 🤣. This really made me think he’s crazy or had something to do with my sickness?! I took anti bacterial medicine upon reading from the internet, and sweated like fuck the whole night. I have never sweated this much ever. The whole bed sheet was soaking wet. It did not fix the fever. 

Booked an Air ticket to Delhi via pay later. Few days later, a lockdown was announced in India, and subsequently, the world went into quarantine. 

![IMG_0915.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Bollywood%20Edition%20Part%204%E2%80%94%20Perso%20f46e4f44e81e4364a20e082999414578/IMG_0915.jpeg)

The Quarantine—>

I seriously thought of having Corona virus, and was scared visiting the doctor at the neighbourhood hospital. They put me on some regular antibiotic course for about a week, and recovered fine during that time. 

Cinemas were gone, restaurants were gone, cafe‘s were gone, most people locked inside concrete boxes.

Why am I hustling so much?! I could live fine within this money coming every month from this job, and maybe, it’s time to take it a little easy, i thought. I had nothing to show for in $$$ terms after throwing the absolute kitchen sink of hustling, and ambition out there. Being “burned out” was an understatement at this stage. Scratched all plans. Saw no point in dealing with OTT platforms, I want to make Art for the cinema, not fit into some stupid marketeers “programming manual.” Decided to focus on inner peace—> zen. Became a little lazy. Thought, maybe I will go back to Dharamshala or Thailand? Oo La la! when things start opening up, and see how it goes. You gotta make the best of cards being dealt. It was time to recalibrate or so, I thought as clearly god had other plans.

What if i had spent all this time + effort on Tech, rather than the movie industry? I thought. There were a lot of questions. 

One thing I was absolutely sure about was being in love with this girl from the north who’s probably as messed up as I was 😘

Things at home were fine initially during the pandemic. Helping other members playing Tambola, eating variety of food, helping with strict pandemic protocols for everything around the house hold to keep everyone safe, watching people doing strange things like ringing utensils to fight the pandemic on the advise of our honourable PM Modi ji. He’s probably getting bored, I thought. lol.

Gal Gadot was not too behind him in inspiring people, but she’s beautiful as well. My habitual twitter news filtering, and management from before the pandemic came handy during this time. It was all part of the discourse when no one knew any better, and probably fine in hindsight. Just mentioning here.

Today I spoke to someone who had to close his Man Power company during the pandemic, and is now selling tea + Banta Soda in Nehru Place. Real issues require real solutions. It was not funny for everyone.

But somewhere things started turning really dark with constant fights, shouting, and just murky atmosphere. It was a tough time, people were going through a lot, but I don’t have to suffer just because some people are unable to manage their emotions. Why am I caught up in this unnecessary drama?! Everyone is adult out here, if you have some issues then talk to each other politely rather than threatening, and cursing everyone around for no reason. If you are over 18, and behaving like a lost kid out of low self esteem then how come i have the responsibility to deal with this stuff?! Even when I tried to deal with these issues as an adult, they would not follow practical advice, but still continue to behave similarly. I am sorry?! Are you people for real?! Or its manipulation for the sake of it, and double speak? Because thats what it seems like. Probably lost about 10 kg’s during this time with the constant rubbish of absolute idiotic people. Don’t want to go into the details.

The construction side job was going fine with ample time to get things done without being on the rush. It was going fine before as well, but there was no time to relax before the pandemic. Don’t want to praise my own self, but I was like a machine running 24x7 with sleep time being the only reprieve. 

Instagram—>

Still checking out my girl on Instagram from my spare insta account, not from the main, didn’t want her to block me there. Trying to figure out what exactly did I do to get blocked? And whats going on with her?! Still posting about us in her long insta posts. She’s the best writer ever. Had to really up my translation game with google translate, filtered with other apps to make sure I was not getting lost in translation while reading all of her more than 500 posts 🥺🥰.

I was checking out her stories, so she knew, and could follow me. But I was not going to follow her first or message because she was the one who had blocked me on both the previous occasions. 

But she didn’t follow me whilst following every tom, dick and harry. Still curious as to what is she doing? She posted an SOS alert at midnight her time, I didn’t respond to it. Knew it was a fake alert, she didn’t even follow me on the platform yet. She immediately blocked me from seeing her insta stories! Why can’t you write to me?! I thought. I still did not send a message. How is blocking a way to start communication? At least follow me? No.

She follows quite a few psychologist on insta including ‘The Holistic Psychologist.’ I can’t remember the name of this particular psychologist, but at the time she was a big follower of this person for relationship posts. One day this famous psychologist posted something about unconditional and true love, and Anna stopped following her. Okay, so she does not believe in love anymore? But that can’t be true, she just does not want to accept it, because i knew she can feel it. Did feel it.

Have you ever had a moment with someone, only a moment, but felt like eternity, and in that tiniest moment you were able to see several layers beneath? I have had that moment with her when we were looking into each other’s eyes, after our first night out, when I fell in love with her. Nothing was really hidden after that moment.

She was still writing about us, teasing me with this or that, I was waiting for her message first. But also her Birthday was around the corner, so I thought about surprising her with some gifts! But then decided upon a gift card form her favourite jewellery shop known as ‘True Treasures.’ All their stuff was really affordable + cultured as she’s not really a “gold digger”, but looking for comfortable intimacy in a constant “teacher mode” wanting “perfection” because of all the bad life experiences.

Got in touch with the couple running True Treasure, they were quite informal in communication while being professional in doing business. I liked that. Reading between the lines, it seemed they were keeping Anna in loop about this.

Also wanted to give her something special.

Detour—>

Me and Ashwin started pushing Hex to find development funding. Cannes was happening virtually that year, so we thought of taking advantage of this being piss poor to actually visit. We were also in touch with Jake Seal, he’s kinda known around those corners. There’s no point in ego as he also works in the same industry, if he could help then we use it. I had also sent him ‘Metagame’ deck only to see if he could do anything with it as well. Had collected several little nuggets, though didn’t know the full extent of his bullshit till then—> he asked us to sign off the project to him, and take creative consultants credit, like he had produced a proper animation film himself? Absolute screwball idiot. We spoke to Enya of Apple TV among others, though no one was ready to come aboard the project at the development stage.

We hired Darren to make a concept poster for Hex to make the deck presentable. Wanted to help him during Covid as well. He did a fine job, though we realised Darren is not really a concept artist. Ashwin paid for this. We had onboarded Tippet Studio as per Ashwin as they were associated with his company, and we were going to work with them for visual development if funding was secured. I never spoke to anyone from that company.

Anna used to really like content of Pascal Champion, a famous concept artist with big Instagram presence. She had also told me about this vivid image of her putting buckets on street lights in her town. First I asked anyone who could have known Pascal, even Darren, and then approached Pascal myself to make a concept image based on Anna’s dream. 

[https://www.iamag.co/the-art-of-pascal-campion/](https://www.iamag.co/the-art-of-pascal-campion/)

It took some effort to get in touch with him, i thought it was al worth it. But he had stopped taking private commission 🤷🏽‍♂️. Therefore, I gave the job to Darren.

Clearly, he’s an awesome and great storyboard artist. However, not so much of a colourist or concept artist.

He even went over, and above to help me out. Making multiple concept sketches. They were all amazing till the sketch stages only. I requested Ash to transfer the money to Darren which was due to me for that month.

Kept thinking about this tweet 🤣

Concept art is a whole another thing that you need to do on its own for optimal results. It had been a while I dived into that. You can’t do writing, extensive reading, and concept art at the same time. I started in Animation doing concept arts. So, not something new, but had been a while. 

Instagram—>

I was reading everything Anna was posting, and liking because I wanted to understand her current state of mind. She had still not messaged or followed me, but was writing all kinds of melodramatic things like myself 😆

Only people I was even talking about this were Chikee, and Charu. Well, it was definitely a mistake to involve Charu, she started posting long self indulgent stuff of her own for me to read. Like what?! Have you heard about only friendships or boundaries? Why is everyone so over confident of knowing better than me? lol. That just shows your own lack of self awareness, and idioticness. I just wanted to keep tabs on the lusty idiot Shakey, and keep Anna safe from more emotional damage. Not to control, but to make aware. Not to ghost or hide to gain power, but to keep with the ground truth. People are doing all kind of stuff to themselves due to non awareness.

From the internet. Please get in touch to take credit as deserved.

Anyway, it’s her birthday! I was really scared, but messaged at midnight her time. Didn’t know how she’ll react. Keeps blocking me for fuck sake 😭.

Anna replied back almost immediately 🥰. Did not block me or anything else. I did not call her straightaway maybe because of inertia? Did not want to make a wrong move, and be blocked again. Thought of just doing as she says till we had established more trust, so that I can go to Russia, and propose her properly. I was not gonna commit or propose for marriage on the internet. lol. 

Did not send the digital paintings to her on the birthday, and she agreed about it not being great when I showed it to her a day or so later.

Anna said she blocked me because I did not reply on Facebook, and I brought up Shakey sending me screenshots of their chats. She did not address that, but still wanted to scold me about what I had said to her in the cab on that night in Delhi. I did say “it’s water under the bridge.” But according to her it was all my fault, and i needed a psychologist to learn self love. Where was I gonna find a psychologist in the pandemic?! I took a trip around the city in a cab 🤣😭. That felt like therapy. It made no sense to say it was all my fault, when she was still doing the same thing. lol. Sure, i could have been more open to being committed, the apprehensiveness did not help to make our bond intimate, that was my fault. She will block me If I speak my mind again, I thought.

Didn’t want to tell her what to do either, she needed to figure that out herself. Awareness is a realisation, not something we can force on people.

I wanted to commit but the way she deserved, also to be able to speak my mind, know whats going on between her and the wannabe pilot. Something she said also made me think if she’s lesbian? lol 😂. We gotta be real to each other to spend the whole life together. She had still not followed me during this whole conversation. But we’re only talking about my “faults.” I thought she was being really cute during all this, well. Tried turning our conversation romantic, though she was stuck on the same tangent.

She is over reliant on other people’s assessment filtered through her own bias to build an image which had nothing to do with me. That’s something about her I got from reading her own posts. Is the lusty idiotic Shakey or envious Gaurav or self indulgent Charu your sources of “intelligence?” Really?! Of course, I had a “profile” of each of these people, how they approach someone, their motive, and their defences. But I am not a psychologist, their character attributes don’t make them a “bad person”, and it’s not my job to interfere. I just wanted my sweetheart to take a broader view. 

I am the person who sweetly held your hand that night, who will never give up on you no matter what, who believe in your heart more than you do ❣️

Asked if she knew the meaning of 

> “Cafuné” a word of Brazilian Portuguese origin, meaning brushing through a loved one’s hair.
> 

But she gave me another lecture about myself 🤦🏽‍♂️. So, either I get blocked on saying the truth or continue this way which is not being myself. Maybe, she needs time to Thing Again? Told her that I respect her, this can’t go on like this, she can get in touch whenever she wants. Disabled that spare Instagram account. Did not block her anywhere. She could have texted me anywhere. 

I was waiting for her text, in fact. But one of her East Asian friends sent me a message on WhatsApp asking if I am a taxi cab driver?! Like What?! Take your time, will visit when I could, and maybe, things will be better in person.

She made a insta post eating a cupcake on her birthday saying that I didn’t understand the gameplay. Really? Why did you not follow me? I was following her. Why stop playing then? She made a story about that wannabe pilot’s gift on her birthday, but nothing about us? I was still blocked from checking her stories on Instagram itself, but there are other ways to check them. Text me? Show some trust, and confidence. Be vulnerable. Otherwise, be with your beloved. Choice is always yours, i can’t force anyone to love, including myself.

J K Rowling, and Bitcoin—>

Bitcoin was having another rally during this time. There was a lot of conversation on social media with some people discovering it recently. Apparently, JK Rowling was one of them. She asked for someone to explain Bitcoin to her in simple language on Twitter. I wrote a short explanation, had it read by few people before replying to her. Don’t think it was acknowledged. But whatever, worth mentioning. 

Twitter—>

Pandemic was an opportunity to connect with long lost connections. I made a twitter account in July of 2009, hadn’t used it much. Pamela Weg was active on twitter, and told me about its benefits at that time. That’s how I became active on twitter. Then figured out my own use case to keep up with tech, light reading in between tasks, and news management filtered through multiple channels right to its source. It was fascinating to track news like that in the age of so much misinformation. 

I kept trying to stay in touch with Pamela after our initial falling out, felt like we had something good going on till I blew it. Always tried to be better than I had been in that weak moment. She used to follow me on twitter as well, so it was at least an acknowledged mutual connection.

Black Flash—>

Had a meeting with Rikhil and Shachi in 2019 trying to get their help in funding TGIRT or even other projects from a person they had been working for at that time. But they had no influence, it didn’t go anywhere. In that meeting, Rikhil said “do you want to get in touch with Pamela?” I was not thinking about her back then, other than sometimes seeing her posts on Twitter. But, why not? He didn’t follow that up either.

Twitter—>

I started replying more, and more to Pamela’s tweets. She used to respond, we started having brief conversations in the DM’s. 

Didn’t think anything would happen as I am in love with Anna. It was just connecting with an old acquaintance kind of thing. We shared some interests, and twitter is a great place to share.

![IMG_1154.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Bollywood%20Edition%20Part%204%E2%80%94%20Perso%20f46e4f44e81e4364a20e082999414578/IMG_1154.jpeg)

Pamela used to post her running track on twitter. 

Made some art from her running race track posts. Pamela liked it. She was even cheering it. Great. If we are connected in anyway then you couldn’t have missed my twitter account, all you had to do was google or visit my website. So, I was pretty sure Anna was checking it out. It was not hidden—> Chikee and Frank used to follow me on Twitter, anyway. Asked Gaurav if he wanted to connect, but he was strangely coy about it, he was weird about everything. I knew pod people had a WhatsApp group, didn’t want to join it.

If Anna can have “options” then I can too. At the same time, it was not like I was spending time with Pamela in a secret room or doing all night calls either. Only sporadic interaction on a public platform.

After Anna’s birthday interaction I had deactivated all social media for a few days. A cat showed up at the house on a rainy day both internal and external, which somewhat helped soothe the emotional baggage.

It felt like this cat had some of Anna’s spirit 🥺🥰🤷🏽‍♂️. Had no interest in talking for long hours with anyone. Happy to listen to other people, but I had a process of my own to think things through, unless we were doing some business together—> In that case, it’s all about getting the thing done, and like to communicate all the time. I was talking more with Pamela after that. There was even some light flirting on twitter only. Didn’t message her on any other platform during this time, she didn’t ask for that either. I didn’t want to start a serious “long distance relationship.” If we can’t be in physical proximity then it’s duh? What? It’s different if you are married or already in a relationship or deeply in love like with Anna—> where it felt like being in a commitment without even saying it. 

![IMG_0471.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Bollywood%20Edition%20Part%204%E2%80%94%20Perso%20f46e4f44e81e4364a20e082999414578/IMG_0471.jpeg)

Started doing some digital painting. Thought, it would be helpful in making concept art for Hex. This above image is a result of random brush strokes. 

I did tell Pamela about wanting to visit Russia, and she advised not to show up at her door unannounced. Yes, I also told her that it felt like gas lighting—> somehow the instagram algorithm kept me up with all this information. Pamela’s birthday is in August, wished her, but did not send her any gift because it was not the same as with Anna. No one is because she’s special.

Construct. Build. Deliver—>

I had been working with Ash since 2014 building the construction business when he was piss poor, helped him right from his first big project by Adam Knibb Architects, we got the lead out of the blue because of the website, and all the accreditations that i got for Ash’s company. Sure, to get them was his idea, but I did ALL the paper work. The company did not even qualify for many of the accreditations. At one point there were about 8 accreditations—> one of them ISO 9001:2000. He even had to redo a large portion of that job for no fault of mine, obviously. Ash did help me on occasions with advances, and rare bonuses—> if you are making £32000.00 with clear profit of £14000.00 and give me £1000 after a lot of negotiation when £8000.00 was added to it because of my mistake, brought to his notice immediately, but he didn’t let me correct it or inform the client, and took the money.

The mistake—> In Excel, it was a typo where instead of 80.00, it became 8000 without the dot.

Of course, the client had that excel sheet, and they never bothered to check it either. They even had a lawyer on board, and paid after we filed a suite in the small claims court. The lawyers never checked it either.

At the same time, he had bought two houses—> one in London itself, and another in Spain. I wasn’t even in the condition to buy a fuckin mattress without stressing about the costs. Must be doing something right if he was making that much money, other than his own efforts? Also, I probably wouldn’t have needed any advances if I was being paid relative London rates, sure you could subsidise since I was working from India, but not paying as much as to a house cat. Just didn’t have any leverage, we would have a falling out whenever I tried negotiating, and his wife would blame me for his heart condition?! If I am so important to the job that you have a heart condition, then pay me more! He would be furious and force me to apologise after every little thing, well if it’s not something worth apologising, then I won’t. What you want me to go all Shakespeare in construction invoices or ledgers? Is someone paying you to act like a weird screwball?! Those were not just my sentiments, but shared across the board by everyone working with him. I am sorry, “for him” as he would insist. 

He once tried to give my job to his daughter, but it didn’t work out because she wouldn’t take his bossiness in kind. Another guy he tried could not make websites. I was not trying to make master pieces when making websites for him, he was not paying extra. So, did whatever was most feasible.

Still thankful as without this job, everything would had been much tougher. It was a remote side job that I could do while sky diving. I learned a lot because of this being completely unrelated to my field of interest, and of how to dealing with people from Ash. As recorded all over this series, I had been trying for one of the projects to start to not have to cope with this side job.

I was also on call 24x7 till the last couple of years. Most of the law suits that we had to deal with were because clients were not happy with his work. Sure, they were all not saints themselves, but Ash had no actual knowledge of construction, and always tried to pull a clever trick rather than doing proper work. He’s a wonderful sales man, with the right motivation he could sell ice in Antarctica. “But he had this qualification, and that qualification”—> on paper. Sure, he might have picked up things while running the business, but it remains a basic fact. Blaming me for “mistakes” was like taking out his frustration on someone for the sake of it. I gave up trying to help him in the last year couple of years I.e 2020 and 2021. Just did whatever needed to be done.

He had hired a project manager to work on site because of his health. Her real name was Amy, but we were supposed to call her Kay because she used to previously work with a client named Shelina, owner of the Hilton Paddington, but at another property, and it was apparently a big secret. She was not happy working for him, but I would only know the whole extent later, as would the readers.

Anyway, wanted to escape all the screaming, and negativity of the house hold. The film industry was still nowhere near a comeback either. I pushed him a bit more, and strangely he agreed to bring me to London. Though, his company was not authorised to apply for proper visa.

Instagram—>

Anna was grieving for some reason, kept writing posts about us, when she could have just sent me a text. Of course, I was reading all of her posts and stories. Maybe, she didn’t feel confident. I was waiting for her to get in touch.

She attended wedding of her brother in btw wearing a MALA she had bought from my gift card. Along with a sad grieving message with a champagne bottle. Why don’t you just text me?!

At one point, she unfollowed a whole lot of people, that’s when I knew she found out about my “spies” Charu, and Chikee. Shakey would try to play her confidante rather than speaking honestly. For him it was a matter of esteem to be friends with her, and maybe get “lucky” if he kept at it. Same case for the wannabe pilot, as well? Here it is only love.

Twitter—>

Pamela asked if I had any plans of coming to London. Guess what? I did. The idea was to keep doing what I was doing for Ash, but also make some connections to find VFX work for Ashwin’s agency, so that I could get 10% cut for the introduction, and client side managing the project. It was not going to be work visa, so there were no concrete plans. All touch, and go. 

One day, we had to get in a Uber to settle a matter based on the above issues at home. I got Pamela’s random message on twitter DM’s, and the coincidence, right after that—> we had to turn back from mid way, suddenly there was no need to attend the matter anymore. Mysterious ways of god?

Pandemic Hotel—>

Like I said, it was tough staying put during the pandemic. When the lockdown restrictions relaxed, decided to head back to the hotel around September. Chikee was already staying there after getting the assistant manager’s number from me. He was also in touch with Anna via Shakey, and I wanted to be in touch with her by any degrees of separation or she could have Just texted me! So, that was another reason. My dad made a huge scene when I was leaving for Mumbai for some reason, he had never behaved like that ever before. Pandemic? Or Something else?

Pamela was also in constant touch, though I was still sceptical if Rikhil had anything to do with this? Didn’t really matter at that time.

My Screen Writers Association membership had expired. Contacted Sanjay to provide a reference, he did. I didn’t want “revenge.“ We could have still worked on some project, and I could have recouped any money lost previously. The other ref was provided by a kind, and unknown gentleman at the SWA office itself.

Guess what? It worked! Anna unblocked me on WhatsApp while I was staying at the hotel. I thanked her immediately. Used to check her account first thing in the morning, and several times during the day. lol. Whenever she would make a post during the pandemic, I used to know instantly, like a tunnel between our hearts ♥️. She did not reply back at that time. Fine. At least, I was not blocked anymore.

I wrote a short film script to help Chikee’s acting career. He really liked it as well, and was pleasantly surprised. His mentors also gave great feedback about it. I think it was one of the best short film script I had written. It still made more sense to focus more on writing even at this time while working to find funding for Hex, rather than pivoting into Tech. 

We didn’t have the money to make the short film. He asked for money from his contacts, and someone suggested to give it, but with gay characters. Well, I am not homophobic, but a story is a story and this film was not written for those characters. I was back in touch with Surbhi Dewan, and tried bringing her onboard to direct the short film if they wanted to go that way, and ready with funding. But nothing materialised in that respect. I told Chikee to feel free to take the script, and do whatever he wants with it—> was a thank you for helping with Anna, though he never admitted to have anything to do with it, but kept asking me to just go to Russia. Well, there were no direct flight from India to Russia at that time because of Covid Restrictions. Also, Indians couldn’t have travelled to Russia from a third location.

There were only couple of other people staying at the hotel during the pandemic. I understood it was tough times for the staff, and the management. They were still steadfast in implementing “the rules.” 

Masks and Gloves—>

Whilst I was staying at the hotel, someone had approached my dad wanting to buy a large quantity of Masks, Gloves and PPE kits. He had put them in touch with a Mr. Murthy from South India who was previously CEO of some airport management company. They were all struggling to make a deals. It was always about to be done, but would never actually get done. It seemed like there was a lot of demand, and not enough supply. But also, lot of people trying to take advantage of the circumstances.

This whole thing was another Priyadarshan movie filled comedy of errors. Even though everyone claimed to have deep pockets, I had to transfer Rupees 4000.00 for accommodation of Mr. Murthy’s aid on behalf of dad, as no one else was ready to pay. Then was asked to meet Mr. Murthy when I was in Mumbai so figure out what’s going on?! He was staying nearby at the Kohinoor Continental Hotel. I was told 99.9% its a done deal. But it never actually got done. There were more and more people involved with time. Even Dad came from Delhi because it was almost done this time. But it was more hilarious meetings where everyone was trying to one up another to cut a person from the middle rather than anything concrete or actual business.

Like, are there even any gloves or not for god sake?! lol. Every morning used to start with tremendous hope, but by the night it all used to turn into disappointment. This was pretty much the whole chain ‘clients>mandates>buyers>media<sellers<suppliers<manufacturers.’ 

Everyone was giving paper guarantees, though no one seemed to have actual money or the supplies. Dad came back with some Vikas from Noida, who was mandated by an international entity to buy a large quantity of gloves, though I remember finding some jinks in his documents. My luggage was still at the Urbanpod hotel, but I was staying with them, paying for our room at Hotel Vits. At one point, the deal was about to get done. We decided to move hotels to not have anyone interfere. 

This new hotel was in ville parle, dad used to stay there on his trips, though I had only stayed once or twice. It was like entering a proper walking dead zone this time around. Just really really eerily. No one liked it. I had to pull some niche moves to get us out of that deal with refund for the remaining days. None of the other people thought it was possible. So, I take some credit. We moved back to the previous hotel. 

Nothing happened again. Even after all that. No actual deal took place, obviously.

The Un-billed Sandwich —>

I had just arrived to Mumbai, and poked Khushbu. She was attending some session arranged by her makeup academy at JWT Marriott, and invited me to join her for breakfast. 

By the time, I reached there she had already eaten, but there was a plate left, I didn’t want to be near it. She said I was looking like a foreign hippie kinda? 

We spent some time around the back garden facing the sea. Joked around if she wanted to sleep over or something, but she was already doing that with a hotel staff apparently. lol. Even showed me a photo, I was not convinced, though what do I care for?! Took some photos of her walking around the ponds as per her request, and then around the deserted areas inside the hotel. 

We settled for some brunch, ordered some drinks, and a sandwich. Hotel didn’t add the sandwich in the bill, maybe I was still under Covid’s influence. Didn’t correct them, and paid as presented. I told Khushbu about this, I wanted to add it to her tab as she was already staying at the hotel, but she insisted that I paid every time we went out. I used to make sure we went Dutch, but this time we already saved some by not paying for the sandwich. 

Sure, they can add this un-billed sandwich to my tab, and would pay next time I am at the Marriotts. 

Diwali—>

I sent these photos to Anna, and Pamela respectively from the Airport while coming back to Delhi.

Both Anna, and Pamela sent Diwali wishes on the night of the festivities. 

Anna and me were having a more informal conversation, it was even funny. Looked like things were getting better.

![IMG_1969.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Bollywood%20Edition%20Part%204%E2%80%94%20Perso%20f46e4f44e81e4364a20e082999414578/IMG_1969.jpeg)

She really loved this joke. I like it when she’s laughing and happy 🥹🥰. She sent me a photo of herself wearing the MALA looking all wonderful as mentioned before.

Gifted her a gift card from ‘True Treasures.’

I wanted to keep talking to her obviously. Sent her something I was working on, and asked for her comments. Like being funny. It was nothing serious.

![IMG_1978.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Bollywood%20Edition%20Part%204%E2%80%94%20Perso%20f46e4f44e81e4364a20e082999414578/IMG_1978.jpeg)

She said that she can’t reply today, she not “in the mood.” 

“I respect that” I said. 

Asked her next day about her mood. This was followed up with really rude lectured about we having different attachment styles, and she doesn’t need to be in touch everyday. She advised me to google attachment style. While posting a instagram, being all strange about it. You can be angry as much as you want without trying to engineer me. You are trying to change a person you fell in love with based on templates on google and your biases based on previous relationship? I was happy to talk about it all, but not being dictated to without any reason.

I was like fuck her. She keeps doing this thing again and again which has nothing to do with me. It’s her own traumas. So, you are alright spending whole nights listening to idiots, and watching screen share movies with them, but it’s a problem when I text you? You should her messages to other tom, dicks, and Harry’s like she’s the nicest person in the world. How could I even video call you then? I myself don’t talk daily with anyone, but are we just anyone? Deleted her contact. 

While speaking to Chikee I expressed my frustration about her behaviour, but also called her a goddess. Within a day she sent me this along with some self indulgent messages—>

![PHOTO-2020-11-23-18-29-53.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Bollywood%20Edition%20Part%204%E2%80%94%20Perso%20f46e4f44e81e4364a20e082999414578/PHOTO-2020-11-23-18-29-53.jpeg)

She was really happy being called a goddess. She is a goddess, I was not lying. That astronaut is supposed to be me. Cool.

Didn’t know how to respond, so I said 👍

If we were playing the game, then I was going to play it well sweetheart.

Told Chikee that I might go to Russia via London as it was impossible from India at that time, anyway. 

Anna posted a dancing video, and another cold proofing her house. I thought a kiss might give her the trust she’s lacking in relationships which makes her gravitate towards template science out of insecurities. Sure, she’s the princess, and I am the frog, but both of their lives got changed with the kiss. 

We need to work on ourselves by default, that’s not even a questions, but can’t force it on the other based on the image in our own head or from feedback of “knowing it all” like Charu or Rikhil. 

Charu’s father was dominant while also requiring support due to his health, while her mother was the emotional support who also got things done around the household. She had been carrying this persona of “Being emotionally sensible“ while keeping all that trauma inside. Just being a different kind of narcissist. Trying to help everyone, but not really helping anyone.

People keep saying silence is great, some things are left unsaid, don’t be honest. Well, that all are rubbish alternatives compared to open, transparent and honest conversations. This is not in reference to any conversations I had with Charu. FYI. It had to ask those specific questions, and she was cagey about answering them.

Rikhil had all together different motivations, and Chikee was trying to be perfect. I didn’t want to interfere in how people thought about themselves.

Pamela was being fine during this time, as if she was the most sensible person in the world.

Got a 6 months tourist VISA. It was probably breaking some rules… if it had worked out, but I was going to do pretty much the same stuff I was doing already, and have some meetings for VFX. It was just about opening the doors to opportunities, and not settle in the house. Hold your judgement.

The Moon Project/ Chandu Ki Lottery—>

Idea to make this project as a zero budget independent film did not work out with the advent of Covid 19, among other problems. There was a call for entry to NFDC Co-production market. The original zero budget version was not going to work there. So, I wrote a completely new treatment. It was a whole other movie, set in the similar world. I didn’t write the script for this new treatment because of burnout of writing so many script that were not getting made into anything. Like said earlier, was getting lazier. Even with the new treatment, it was still an outsider project, more commercial than they are used to at film bazaar.

Next thing we know, The Moon Project was short listed for the coproduction market. They wanted the script in 3 days. So, the treatment was typos free! It was going to be difficult, but not something I couldn’t do! We even got an extension of 24 hours. I did not sleep for 3 days, drank a lot of Americano + Cadbury Crackles, and wrote 100+ pages. It was a fine first draft. Even though we did a proofread among ourselves, there were bound to be some types when you are working at that speed. It’s not just typing but thinking on multiple levels that fast. Submitted. Pamela was kinda supportive during that time. Maybe, we exchanged only one message, but still. I was also checking out Anna’s insta stories in the downtime. 

Pandemic Strikes Back—>

Around the day I was supposed to leave for London, new lockdown restrictions were put in London due to fresh new cases. Offices were mostly shut, though it had minimum effect on construction business even before these latest protocols. 

Pamela was anticipating my arrival, and even disappointed due to the delay. We even had a chat about not being able to meet immediately as I land because of the Covid protocols, and she was not happy about that either. I was also excited to meet her. Before that she had mentioned going to see the Christmas lights with someone, I joked if she was dating and something about us. Lightness. We were getting a little cozy, as much as you could on twitter. lol. She sent a photo of the full moon from her back yard with something, something message, we had a whole conversation. I did inquire if she liked vintage jewellery, which I already knew she liked, but did not buy anything. Was not sure. That would be too much, I thought.

There were a lot of information leaks, and didn’t know who was talking to whom at this point. I had introduced everyone to everyone I knew. So, it could be a whole lot of WhatsApp groups discussing this exciting topic in the age of the pandemic. Might have thrown some curve balls to extract the leeches.

Asked Ash to buy me Air Tickets on company account because I was travelling for work? He completely refused. So, I had to buy my own Air ticket to London.

![IMG_2050.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Bollywood%20Edition%20Part%204%E2%80%94%20Perso%20f46e4f44e81e4364a20e082999414578/IMG_2050.jpeg)

So Long, London—>

The immigration officer asked about my occupation, and I told him that I write movies. He couldn’t believe it, well neither could I. lol. Seemed satisfied, and I entered London. Also, filled the travel locator form as required during Covid 19. No one bother to locate me after that. 

First text I got upon getting out of the airport was from Pamela, and it said “Welcome to London.” We exchanged some texts, and I was on my way to the hotel.

Ash had originally asked me to move in with Amy/Kay in Shooter’s Hill, Greenwich as she had a spare room, and was staying alone with her son. But Greenwich is too far from Lancaster Gate, and I wanted to stay in Central London. Also, it didn’t seem appropriate staying with a woman when I was already in pursuit of complicated relationships. I like hotels more than any other kind of accommodation as there is no commitment, and absolute freedom. Russian embassy was also nearby, if and when plans materialised.

Most hotels were closed or working in limited capacity because of Covid 19. The hotel Ash had arranged for me was Élysées Hyde Park. Said the hotel owner was his friend. Jake had also booked this same hotel for when we worked on the Najwa Karam 3d Music Video for Sony, and said the hotel’s owner was his friend. Okay. It was right opposite Mitre Pub. Pamela had mentioned having some connection to Mitre. We are all surrounded by Coincidences. Shiela’s cafe’s was slightly opposite at a degree to this hotel. Interesting. Back on old stomping grounds.

I had to follow all the self isolation rules as mentioned here or pay a fine of £1000.00 which was not an option because that’s pretty much all the savings I had, give or take.

[Travel corridor update, 3 December 2020](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/travel-corridor-update-3-december-2020)

There were some loop holes where If I could spend 7 days in quarantine upon arrival, and get tested again, then I could be exempt. But the cost of testing was crazy high. I had already been tested in India before arriving here as per the rules. 

At the hotel front reception, I was greeted by dude from South India. He had a packet ready with including the local mobile phone chips I had ordered, and Ash’s old IPhoneX. The speaker phone malfunctioned, and the battery was completely gone, but otherwise it worked fine. He was surprised when I told him it’s working.

They gave me an attic room at first, on the top floor of the hotel. But it was too congested, so I asked for them to change it. The whole place was empty. I was then shifted to a room on the first floor looking right into the first floor of The Mitre. I was roaming around in shorts, the heating was on, therefore, kept the curtains right in front of the bed closed as that would have given ful view of my junk when lying down. 

![IMG_2055.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Bollywood%20Edition%20Part%204%E2%80%94%20Perso%20f46e4f44e81e4364a20e082999414578/IMG_2055.jpeg)

Exchanged phone numbers with Pamela, and now we were chatting on WhatsApp. She had a photo of herself in childhood as the DP. I was a bit flirty as usual, and she was responding.

Of course, I was still checking out Anna’s insta stories, and listening to this song—>

["Hey it's Delilah" (Girls Version of "Hey There Delilah")](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXWGo4EhE84)

And—> 

[Beach House - Space Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBtlPT23PTM)

I am only in love with Anna. 

Pamela, was only some attachment carried on by grief, and then friendliness. 

I wrote to Anna. So, what if she’s totally crazy? I thought. I love her 😁😭❣️. She was busy taking part in some English teachers online conference. Said will contact me tomorrow. Already knew that from her insta stories. Cool.

Previous day, we received rejection from NFDC for The Moon Project/ Chandu Ki Lottery. No reason was provided. I was like there’s no winning these guys for something that happens rarely, has now happened with me twice—> first they rejected TGIRT after short listing, and now TMP. Clearly, there’s more than meets the eye. Does that mean I have to take this construction thing seriously? This can’t be right. 

Another person to contact me on the day I reached London was this Astrologer who used to stay in The Urban Pod hotel. I never interacted with him much other than my customary hi or hello, sometimes when he was parking his Mercedes. I only used to act impressed to make him feel better about himself. So, it was strange that he would call me out of the blue. It didn’t make much sense.

I was talking to Pamela frequently, we shared voice messages, she sounded different from what I had remembered. Told her I am reading Frank O Hara’s poem, someone posted it no twitter, I guess. Why can’t a heterosexual man like myself read a poem by a gay poet?! What’s controversial about that? Maybe, the problem is in the way you think?

Anyway, I shared my frustration with being in the quarantine, it was difficult already in couple of days. She told me “it’s part of the process.” 

One day, there was more than usual activity at The Mitre, especially on the first floor dinning area. 

Suddenly, and out of her twitter character Pamela started posting photos of her dating. She had never done that before. This was getting weird. So, now I am thinking, it was not all my fault the first time around? She’s toxic.

I tried to express myself the next day, she suddenly sounded like a completely different person. Even told her that “I do love you.” She said she’s dating, and that I am delusional. hmm. I asked her to read all of our conversations on DM’s and here on WhatsApp itself. They were provable who’s sensible and who’s delusional right away. What are you even talking about? Who do you think you are talking to? Is she taking revenge? WTF!

Pretty much told her to fuck off by saying “never contact me again” and blocked her on WhatsApp, first. Also, deactivated twitter. I was not so much heart broken, but completely shocked with the toxicity of people. Anyway, it didn’t matter as I was in love with Anna. 

I try to find my own faults in every situation, it’s also part of the process. That was an ongoing thing. That’s not being self critical, but being self aware. 

LEC was renovating, and restoring Blackmore Hotel about 500m from where I was staying, owned by a Spanish owner who also owned a restaurant in the same locality called Halepi. Ash knew Steve Kazolides, owner for a long time as per his own account. I was still doing all the usual work for construction with some added responsibilities.

Ash and his wife Chico were very kind in bringing dinner in the first week of the quarantine. It was totally my kind of food as well with some chocolates. They used to live 5 minutes away. My account at WISE, by Google was registered at their address, and had also received the multi currency travellers Mastercard which made it easier to navigate. 

Used to spend some time walking around the reception area as I couldn’t step outside the hotel as per the self isolation rules. Started talking to the manager Mr. Dilawer, and he introduced me to his daughter Karishma who used to take a shift at the hotel reception. 

Saw Mike, Jake’s father walking across the front of the hotel one evening while I was talking to Karishma. He just kept walking, and didn’t look at me. Of course, he looked older, it’s been 8 years. Aah.

Karishma and Dilawer were really interested in the topic of making money via stocks or anyway literally. They used to live in Harrow, a Gujarati hub in London, and wanted to upgrade their life. I tried sharing some of knowledge about stocks, and bitcoin with them, but with caution because they seemed like the kind of people who could get carried away, and lose their fortune. Kept telling them to keep learning rather than trying to make money of stocks or crypto until they actually understood the nitty gritty. They were already trading via some consumer app. I can only warn. 

At the end of the 1 week quarantine, Ash was pushing me to visit the construction site, but I just wanted to be cautious. Didn’t want to lose £1000.00 and none of the coincidences were quite pleasant, to be honest. 

Wilson—>

I had been in touch with Laura during the pandemic, but she never finished a conversation for some strange reason. That was quite unlike her. Texted if she was around. She was in a relationship, but what’s wrong with a coffee? I thought. But apparently not.

Used to follow one of Laura’s girl friends on twitter who posted a really weird tweet at the same time about “how women should not waste their lives waiting for one man.” Like what?! What Have you heard? More coincidences. 

Gossip is not reality. Reality is reality. 

Black, Grey, and White—>

I was handed over the keys to the building structure owned by the Chinese lady that she wanted to sell for £35 Million. No, they didn’t just give it to me. Couple of builders were supposed to do some work there, and I was asked to supervise. Took some photos—>

I was still exchanging texts with Anna, shared some zen with her because you never know about her mood.

![61e9fe6a-91e3-4874-818f-c46ac00d314f.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Bollywood%20Edition%20Part%204%E2%80%94%20Perso%20f46e4f44e81e4364a20e082999414578/61e9fe6a-91e3-4874-818f-c46ac00d314f.jpeg)

Lockdown restrictions were getting strict by the day. Still, no effect on construction sites. Pretty much everything else was affected. 

Ash was not keeping well, he had a procedure done to his heart, and another was due. That’s another reason I was brought over.

I started visiting the construction site. Met Kay/ Amy, she seemed like a strong, self reliant women who could drive a construction Van! Nice. She also had complicated relationships, and mood swings. It’s all just being part of being human. She was concerned with the crew not giving her the respect, but at the same time it was work dynamics with Ash running it like a dictator, and crew from everywhere including Greg and couple of other guys from Poland, Mourad the driver from Morocco, Bayer from Mongolia, Arnie and few other labourers from Romania. 

At the time, and before that I was part of a WhatsApp group, where I used to send some updates from time to time. Also, when Ash had to rushed to emergency, I helped coordinate in his absence. Everyone was scared of losing their jobs. Those were crucial times. That’s why some people already knew me as a person who managed computers, accounts, money and can get stuff done on a phone call. Like all images, it was not all true. I never had any access to the actual company accounts which makes sense as I was being underpaid myself. lol.

I used to wear couple of masks for Safety after seeng Tom Cruise doing the same on the set of his film, I think. But i was really cautious in general as the last thing I wanted was to catch the virus here. Ash was paying me London rates, all of which was going towards the hotel rent, and expenses. He was supposed to sponsor my trip, so it was still not breaking the law.

The crew at the site, both the main contractor, and our company kept asking me to buy construction shoes, but I was still evaluating my stay and future. Covid restrictions didn’t seem like they were going to ease anytime soon, which meant I couldn’t contact people for meetings for VFX. It was apocalyptic to say the least. Didn’t make sense. If anything were to happen to Ash which if you looked at him seemed only a matter of time, then I would be in a soup without a proper visa. So, it was still watch and go. 

Ash’s company was doing some second order works while there were another main contractor carrying out major works. It was all up in the air with almost nothing running on schedule or with much clarity. Everyone had their own version of what needed to be done. Amy was frustrated because of not having absolute authority over the crew with them always looking for Ash’s approval while she was in charge on site. Ash had to coordinate with the client, the other company, and Ash about the progress as per agreed schedule while ash would give the crew conflicting instruction. Chico was in charge of payouts, she would ask Bayer to take money out of the card, but call Amy to distribute the cash. One day, a bunch of people were told to wash the van rather than doing the actual work. 

I was not trying to interfere into anyone’s work, just scoping and reading it all. It was scary to climb the scaffolding first time around, there was no safety belts like all it would take is a strong blow of air to knock me down! But it is only a problem in the beginning, then I make exponential growth. 

Mourad fell ill so Amy was driving the van. There was another project on going close to Amy’s home, renovating home of her friends from Japan and South Korea about to get a divorce. Like I said, It was all messed up.

I was already on top of the our side of accounts, in fact had to correct the client’s old accountant on couple of occasions. Steve even offered me to work for him directly, he said “we need people like you.” When he heard that I am leaving in a few days.

Used to buy food, and groceries from the Waitrose at a gas station in the same locality. Budget was tight. The temperatures were hitting quite low by now like 0 degrees Celsius. I didn’t pack any warmers or warm socks. The formal shoes I had brought were hurting my toe because the shape of the shoe did not match my foot, and was really painful if worn for long hours. I took a long walk one night from the hotel to Bloomsbury square, and it was just unbearable.

Had brought another ultra casual pair which was made for the summer. But somehow it worked out.

After the completion of the self isolation period I had been shifted to another room on 3rd floor with the view of Hyde Park. Almost.

Mr and Mrs Adam’s Chocolates—>

Ash had contacted me in 2014 to help him invoice a client. That’s how we got started. He used to run a grocery shop back then that I had helped him with the paper work before leaving London. Chico used to work for Ash at the grocery store, thats how they met. 

One of our first clients were Mr and Mrs. Adam. I had made few invoices for them by now. Ash would keep telling me a story about Mrs. Adam appearing in her towel in front of the construction workers, for some reason. What’s the big deal? I thought it’s one of Ash’s silliness, more than anything else. He had recently converted the vaults in front of their house into a kitchen, and workshop. 

I was walking back home with Ash from construction site, and looking at a Hotel we were trying to get as a renovation project Massimo, an Italian architect introduced from a different hotel project. That’s when Mr. Adams showed up. Kinda in his 80’s, little shorter in height than me, smart, you could tell. Told me about his short stories, and how he wanted to publish them. I thought they would be really interesting, him speculatively being a retired MI6/ CIA spy. He told me about couple of them, and they sounded like something I would have liked to read.

We decided to take a walk to his house in Queens Gardens. He told me about their time in Cyprus. Only person I knew from Cyprus was a girl editor named Margarita Iosif who used to freelance for Jake back in the days. She was wonderful. Anyway, Mr. And Mrs. Adams used to run a cafe of their own in Cyprus, but had to leave for some reason. He said it’s beautiful, and sunny for the most part.

I met Mrs. Adams upon reaching the house, and she told me the same story that Ash used to tell so often. Okay?! So, it was not just his silliness. Why do they keep telling this story?! 

Mr. Adams gave me tour of the vaults that Ash’s company had built, and was now his chocolate workshop. Though, he was not totally happy with the works. He had the cocoa plants and everything. It seemed totally legit. 

![IMG_4131.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Bollywood%20Edition%20Part%204%E2%80%94%20Perso%20f46e4f44e81e4364a20e082999414578/IMG_4131.jpeg)

Told me about his method of making chocolate, and it being better than what you get in the markets, because his chocolates were made from pure cocoa. He even had me taste chocolate he had extracted directly from the plant. It was wonderful.

![PHOTO-2020-12-22-15-20-33.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Bollywood%20Edition%20Part%204%E2%80%94%20Perso%20f46e4f44e81e4364a20e082999414578/PHOTO-2020-12-22-15-20-33.jpeg)

Mr. Adams offered me a pack of chocolates as a thank you for helping him with the customer care to get a package delivered for his daughter, and her kids on Christmas. They asked me to share it with Ash and Chico. Mentioned about sharing his chocolates with them before as well.

Then he took me for a tour of his house, his family’s flag, the family tree, showed all the wonderful books he had including a book from some famous Polish author about polish history. “Maybe you should have shown it to me few days earlier” I said in ref to Pamela. It was all very fascinating, and I could have spent hours listening to him, though had to excuse myself. 

I called Ash on my way back to the hotel to ask if he would like to take some of these chocolates, but he declined. 

Anna liked chocolates, I knew, but still asked because I wanted to talk to her 🤷🏽‍♂️. She gladly shared her address to receive the chocolates as a gift.

![PHOTO-2020-12-22-15-20-07.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Bollywood%20Edition%20Part%204%E2%80%94%20Perso%20f46e4f44e81e4364a20e082999414578/PHOTO-2020-12-22-15-20-07.jpeg)

She had earlier shared a cute photo of herself.

![6061df5b-eca3-4f44-ab64-1624cdecf3d2.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Bollywood%20Edition%20Part%204%E2%80%94%20Perso%20f46e4f44e81e4364a20e082999414578/6061df5b-eca3-4f44-ab64-1624cdecf3d2.jpeg)

I contacted DHL for delivery to Russia, but there were Covid restrictions due to which it was really expensive with no guarantee of getting there on time. 

So, i was getting bored, and ate couple of chocolates from the box. It more romantic if we shared. lol.

Then i ate couple of them more. They were just too good! Next thing i know, the whole box was empty in a few days 🤣

I asked Amy if Mr. Adams would give me more chocolates to fill the box? But she remembered him promising chocolates to her as well. She called him, and think, he did give her a box.

The Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future—>

Instead of the Chocolates, sent another gift card from True Treasures for Christmas to Anna. She was happy about it. But something was going on as she was posting weird stuff in her insta stories. Like someone’s giving her fake info or she’s overthinking. I was too touchy and careful as well which is its own type of over thinking.

Ash invited me over for Christmas to collect some food Chico had prepared, and to have a chat. When I was there, he changed his mind and I joined them for the Christmas lunch. Chico didn’t seem completely happy about it as she was the only one cooking. Ash kept adding items to the list. She was better after having few sips of wine. I also had some of that. The spread was nice. They also packed some for later. Ash said the neighbours could report us, as gathering of three people was not allowed. Well, okay? So, were we having an illegal lunch? lol.

The restaurants, and pubs were all shut. Even the Mitre. Keep using this word, but it did seem apocalyptic. 

![IMG_3976.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Bollywood%20Edition%20Part%204%E2%80%94%20Perso%20f46e4f44e81e4364a20e082999414578/IMG_3976.jpeg)

![IMG_3917.jpeg](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Bollywood%20Edition%20Part%204%E2%80%94%20Perso%20f46e4f44e81e4364a20e082999414578/IMG_3917.jpeg)

At this point, I knew Ash pretty well. He was a good friend, but Scrooge when it came to business, and not just the greedy, but also being insecure, and egoistic. I used to run everything past him, so he couldn’t raise a question upon it later as my fault. Amy even asked why I confirm everything with him, and it seemed like a thorough process but overdone. So, I explained it to her—> it’s his business, and responsibility because thats how he likes it. I am just executing whatever he wants done within the financial obligation. 

I used to send the schedule to the guys with Amy’s help, but later Ash said she should prepare and send it. She was not happy with another thing added to her long list along with driving the van.

Yet, there was an issue of raised with the intention of trying to make it look like my mistake. They said I authorised some purchase when Amy had authorised it. Greg came into the basement with a suggestion, Amy was using a table there as her office, and I used to just hang out there sometimes. It had a heater. Asked her to make a decision in Ash’s absence. It was about some filler, the old one was not working. Client was not happy. She made the right decision at that time.

This whole thing was spun around in some strange way. At first, it started with an argument between Amy and Ash while in the Van. His main issue was to establish his superiority. Other issues about the working relationship were being brought forth. She was not table to handle it, so I took over, trying to explain the logic to Ash. But now, he started barging on me for no reason, and I don’t take that kindly. Amy was surprised that I told him to fuck himself. He told me that I am fired! lol. Are you kidding with me?! Chico took over and started shouting at me as well for making him shout. I was trying to stop the fight in the first place!

Amy told me about all the other things while we were standing in front of the Bayswater station as she had to take a tube home that day. Cold wind was blowing at certain speed, and I was feeling a bit uneasy. While already being told that “I am fired.” I got nothing here, and I am not authorised to work! Of course, I can take a flight back but then what! The scripts were already copied, stolen or rejected for the time being. 

A day before, I had a drink with the whole crew locked up in a room. Didn’t want to disappoint them, took off my masks before putting them back on after only a couple of sips. Had the rest of it without anyone around. 

I was just outside the hotel, when I revived a call from Ash, and it seemed I was not fired. But now it was about his ego, and he was going to investigate. There was another incident when something was being made to look like my fault for Mourad buying something, but there were messages that time. 

It was the cold, this tension, and maybe I touched something. I don’t know but I was not well. Difficulty breathing, fever and feeling chills. A day before, I had taken a nap in the room with a window open, and without a shirt. Maybe, it was that? I didn’t know. 

Had an argument with Anna that night when she overreacted with one of her 180 degree turns, and said that I am asking a personal questions when she herself stated the topic of her career, and we were talking about all sought of things. She also said that we did’t have a bond. Which was not true at all. I mean common, you just gave e your address, i sent you a Christmas gift card. Like said previously, overthinking or someone putting things in her head. She thought I was interested only because she was a women and had boobs 😭.

![IMG_2105.png](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Bollywood%20Edition%20Part%204%E2%80%94%20Perso%20f46e4f44e81e4364a20e082999414578/IMG_2105.png)

I told her about my health and unable to take this 180 degree turns. She thought I was being passive aggressive. I didn’t reply back.

Well, this time life was being passive aggressive, I was not.

I woke up feeling really cold, not well, but Ash and Chico didn’t believe me either. Why? What?! They thought I was making this up because of the arguments on the previous evening, and pushed me to pick something from the Queensway market, and to get the work started on site as Amy was going to be coming in late. Took a paracetamol, double masked, and got the keys from Chico who also gave me a muffler to keep warm.

Amy came a bit later, we were talking in her office. She saw that I was shivering even with heating on full. Told her I had taken another paracetamol within 4 hours while wearing several layers of clothing. She advised me to go back to the hotel. I told Ash, and still did whatever I could digitally from the hotel room.

Next morning, I received a call from Akash of SixD. He was asking for my help in registering a company in London. Well, it was all there on the internet for a simple google search. Told him I am not well. But he insisted. Gave him the exact steps, and a link. We had met before I left for London, and they spoke about wanting to setup something there. Obviously, I didn’t take them seriously. He asked If I wanted to speak with Charu? Hmm not particularly, but sure? He gave the phone to her, and she was giving me some time slot. Told her I am not really interested. What is all this about? Whatever.

I had been floating the idea of staying at the Blackmore Hotel itself to save money, and being more useful. It was difficult because we were not the main contractor. We had submitted the presentation for the other hotel project on the same street as the main contractors, but it didn’t seem like that was going to start anytime soon either, if ever. Had pretty much made up my mind about this not being for me in the short or long term, however, I had to recoup the air tickets + have some saving for all this effort. Also, i wanted to make sure that I was not needed as Ash’s surgery date at the hospital was delayed by more than a month. 

On the way to our site, another Hotel was being reconstructed and renovated.

[VIDEO-2020-12-17-16-02-22.mp4](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Bollywood%20Edition%20Part%204%E2%80%94%20Perso%20f46e4f44e81e4364a20e082999414578/VIDEO-2020-12-17-16-02-22.mp4)

Other than the construction crew, I got a chance to put faces on names i had been talking to via emails for almost 10 years. This included Mr. Barry Jenkinson, a really experienced quantity surveyor who had been helping us in costing big projects since the Adam Knibb job. He looked like an old magician with his white beard, and formal manners.

Ash and me also took a bus to visit house of deceased Mrs. Bhatia in Pimlico, she had passed away during Covid lockdown after being ill for a long time, and she was also quite old. Shelina, her daughter had taken over the business as far as I knew. We had done some renovation work at this house, and some things were left to be fixed. We also got to meet the old maid who used to take care of Mrs. Bhatia, and she had so many stories along with a general dislike for most things. I visited this place again with Mourad, and a builder to finish up the works. 

Used to talk to Karishma during the evening while walking around in the reception area. Like already mentioned, she was quite interested in talking about stocks, bitcoin, but also telling her stories. I had no feelings for her, but the name ‘Karishma’ means a little more than any other. I wanted to help. Suggested she should contact Shelina for a better paid than at this place, she had many properties, and they were from the same Khoja/ Ismaili lineage. One evening, an old polish maintenance worker of the hotel came through the front door while we were talking, and asked “is your boy friend going to drop you to the tube station?” Ringing in my ear. Repeated this few times in my head, and disappeared back into my room. She was cute, and all, but I am in love with Anna.

Mr. Dilawar, Karishma’s dad was quite a storyteller himself. He definitely had something in his mind. Sorry, but I had other plans.

I had joked with Amy about having a girlfriend in every city when she asked how am I handling this Pamela thing so well? But then also gave her the real reason—> “because I am in love with Anna.” This thing was like visiting the past in the strangest way possible. Like, being put in some sort of multi dimensional Time Machine to twist, twirl, and turn to heal. 

New Year, New Plans—>

I was looking to save money, and not spending all of it on accommodation was a good way of doing that. Did negotiate something with Mr. Dilawar, but it was still expensive. I kept looking, and found few options within that locality. However, the lockdown restrictions got even more stricter, and there was some news of all international flights to India being banned or all flights from the Uk to be grounded. Either way, I was going to get fucked if few other scenarios didn’t workout in my favour. 

Amy would tell me all these stories from her part of the city, and I thought it could be a really niche television series like fusion of The Wire and Sopranos. Maybe, it’s time to move on from East Enders? lol. She used to make cakes, and was interested in making content. Even made a quick poster. We were not each other type that ways, but friends only.

A great thing about being a writer is that even if something doesn’t work out, you can still make or use it in a movie or a book or a blog 😅.

Wandered around before, and on the New Year’s Day morning.

Ash was trying to tune me, to control me. To be honest, and without any disrespect, this was not the best use of my time. He spun the whole thing like it was my fault when I had little to do with it, and was only trying to help his operation run like a machine so he would have less head ache, and a better heart. Rather than the way he was running it. But what can you do in the face of unawareness of others?! He decided to arrange something like a court hearing. lol. Do you know my great grand father was a public prosecutor?! He was being silly, even told him that anyway I am leaving, whats the point?! But it was about his ego.

Usually, I book tickets online, but used a travel agent for this trip used to have a point of reference who could contact someone other than customer care in case of an emergency. If anything went wrong due to Covid. It was booked for the 9th of Jan.

Hearing was a day before I was supposed to be leaving. Greg was working at Amy’s friend’s project in Greenwich during this time. They were all going to blame me. But none of them could answer the honest questions including Amy, who chose to be silent rather than being honest. Greg threatened to “crack my head open.” Amy was laughing at that. Okay? Maybe, I shouldn’t have helped you. I told him to try it. He was angry because his lies were not working, and Ash was trying his best to make me apologise, because that would give him some weird sense of satisfaction. I only apologised for swearing at Greg, and gave a solid drubbing to all of them for trying to run a fake court session. It was clear whose fault it was. But really it was Ash’s toxic “masculinity.” I was not only standing, but sitting on my ground.

This reaffirmed my decision to book the ticket. I was not going to waste my time dealing with idioticness.

Had to get a Covid 19 test done as part of the transit rules. It costed £225.00, no I am not kidding and that was the last of my saving from the money Ash had given me there. It was a little extra expensive because I had to have the results in 24 hours. But the same tests in India, and even Russia were less than 1/3 of that cost. 

![IMG_0483.png](How%20not%20to%20startup%20Bollywood%20Edition%20Part%204%E2%80%94%20Perso%20f46e4f44e81e4364a20e082999414578/IMG_0483.png)

I was already under Rupees 90 grand overall after paying for the air tickets. But I was getting to keep the job as per our previous arrangement. A proper visa would have given me options, and I would have stayed back without any problems. Though, this current arrangement was just not going to work in my favour from any angle.

On the day of departure, Ash took me to his garage/ store room few miles away from Lancaster Gate, and had me rearrange a part of it, for some reason. Didn’t want to disappoint him, he’s old with a heart patients, maybe he was also completely losing his marbles, I thought. Chico was not very happy with me leaving so soon, she wanted the iPhone X back. lol. You can say many things about Ash, but he was not that cheap. I liked him as a friend, but we worked at different frequencies and aesthetics for me to work directly “for him.” We could have been cofounders maybe, if he was born a little later 🤷🏽‍♂️. 

I arrived on 8th Dec, and was already taking a flight back on 9th Jan. Leaving things a little better?

Extras—>

There’s fake bullshit spread by naysaying idiots like Jake, Ashwin, Sanjay and Sid about “hardwork” when was the last time any one of them did hardwork or took an actual initiative? Who’s written all these essays? And who’s making conveniently fake comments? So, you are saying writing full fledged scripts or completing actual projects is not hardwork? I can keep going on and on about such stupid argument. STFU.

Read a post on twitter by some numb nut criticising thinking, logic and imagination, but also separating these from action. Taking advantage of opportunities created by others through network effects is a social skill, though let’s not confuse it with doing the actual work of thinking + action it takes to create those opportunities. 

There are various examples of incompetent hacks conveniently riding on network effects rather than hard or smart work, but influencing others because it’s easy. Like, getting into politics because daddy and mommy used to be in the same profession, but still suck when all they had to do was helping people by improving systems. But most of the fight is not for improvement, but to take credit by those who don’t actually do anything. Gandhi Ji did not do Dandi march on a luxury bus or for votes or credit, for example. Whatever. Just saying the kind of people i find irritating.
