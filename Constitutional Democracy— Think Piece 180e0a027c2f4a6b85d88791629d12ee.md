This short essay is to celebrate the auspicious occasion of India’s 75th Republic Day!

By the people, for the people, of the people! We all know this but what does it actually mean? It’s the biggest strength of a constitutional democracy and puts it above any other kind of organisational regime.

“God

Nation

Leader”

I just could not agree. For starters, God/ Bhagwan is above everything and everyone, should not even be on any list of hierarchy. To compare any leader with God is nothing but egoistic.

If we have to make a list then we need to start with—> Humanity. Basic universal and shared human values that binds all of us into one thread of which we ourselves make several sub threads.

Next on the list would be—> The Constitution along with the system in place to keep improving the constitution based on the needs of the time for the welfare of the people. Which automatically means the Nation and by extension everything connected to the nation.

Then would be—> The People themselves, every single person in the country regardless of their perceived “standing” through any form of social filters. As depicted by the icon of this essay.

That’s it, the Complete list 👆

Leaders come from the people of the nation itself which only a democratic system can appreciate. That’s by design of the system as anyone chosen through a fair electoral process is fulfilling this responsibility bestowed upon them by the people.

India is already a decentralised system as we chose local candidates who then choses their representative leader for smooth functioning when implemented in that spirit. The potential of this system depends on both the chosen representative and the local candidates fulfilling their duties with strict democratic values. This system is obviously similar to UK 🇬🇧  with some necessary changes.

USA 🇺🇸 has both a decentralised and a centralised system to complement different branches of the mechanism for assessment and delivery. The values are similar even if the processes do vary.

If democratically chosen leaders do their job well then they are appreciated by the people, it’s not something they are doing as a gift to anyone but to state the obvious again ‘fulfilling their responsibility’ prescribed to them as per the constitution. If anyone is not doing this job well then they are condemned, it’s not a favour to anyone to do your job well. The condemnation can come from one or several, thats the beauty of a democracy that citizens can voice their opinions.

There is a reason for why democracies flourish compared to any other form of organisational political system—> we all have limited lifetime, we also have limited window in which we can exceptionally fulfil duties as leaders in any field or domain. This is based on an understanding that change is the only constant as observed in the sacred Bhagavad Gita and other spiritual texts.

Democracies do not rely on one leader or person but on a process that can deliver, therefore, a leader’s job more than anything is to strengthen the process itself and make sure it delivers inspite of the leadership.

I read somewhere that the true test of leadership is how many leaders they build to proceed them because its a fact any great leader understands whether in corporate or geopolitics that they won’t be able to see the whole vision implemented in their own lifetime and definitely not in their own tenure and necessary changes would be required which is only possible with assessment and delivery mechanisms. This is not only about ability or will power either but also behavioural science—> job of a leaders in democracies is to push through for speed while making sure the processes are being followed with required improvements.

It’s beautiful that human brain came up with this natural process of societal functioning which is relevant to every continent, country, county and organisation throughout the globe. It might seem as if democratic values are a burden, but that’s just laziness of the people who don’t want to do the work required ‘with the people.’

There are many arguments for other types of organisational regimes but thats just short sightedness. Short term thinking might show immediate results or what might seem like results but there is no sustainability or longevity in any form of non democratic regimes because there’s no guarantee that the next leader will uphold the same ethical values across the board as the previous—> this is not an endorsement of anyone, just a way of explaining the point.

I would also like to add capitalism into the mix because democracies and capitalism go hand in hand. Most people misunderstand socialism as equality when it only means control, we saw the experiment play out during the Cold War which is to learn from rather than clinging on to something that does not work. It was fine when in theory socialism seemed like a beacon of hope, therefore, many intelligent and respectful people from history wanted it implemented in practice. However, it does not work, its not natural, its not sustainable and it does not evolve as capitalism does which also has its own problems, though it works unilaterally in both domestic and global markets despite of the challenges.

Being a constitutional democratic republic is a strength I hope we can keep celebrating in India and throughout the globe far far into the future. Jai Hind 🙏🏾
